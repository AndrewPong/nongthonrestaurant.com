<div>Chapter One</div>
<div>Have Pity On the Desperate</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>************</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Hey! Last stop!&quot; The driver up front shouted, his eyes peeking at her through the rear mirror.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The throbbing headache was beginning to dispense. Gillian tried to get up but her muscles were screaming in protest at her effort. A little groan escaped from her as she injected all her strength and lifted herself up.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When she passed the driver, she saw him rolling his eyes in derision. Stupid bastard, she thought. Didn't he know how to treat his passengers with a little respect? So okay, maybe she did ignore him the first time, but that was because she was nowhere near a clear mind. Perhaps the idiot should rethink first and blame himself for tuning in the radio and having soft, melodic songs played in the background. Like, seriously. Who won't fall dead on those things?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Her eyes widened at the sudden realization that she almost left her luggage behind. She quickly rotated and requested for the driver to wait as she mounted the bus to fetch for her belongings. He, again, used the gesture of contempt ever so irritably and tapped an impatient finger on the wheel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Hurry up, will you?&quot; The driver groaned peevishly at the thought that his lunch hour was delayed because of the lazy passenger. Make it a lazy passenger who had a problem getting on people's nerves.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When she retrieved the luggage, she trudged down the steps with tremendous effort. The weight of the luggage made it gravely difficult for her petite frame, but part of her knew that the driver wasn't going to be that nice to offer her his help. Yet, another part of her was foolishly hoping he would drop the grudge and be a gentleman for once. What's up with Hong Kong people and their pettiness? Sheesh.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;I'll help,&quot; announced a voice, sort of gentle, sort of rough, but most surprisingly of all, sort of eager and enthusiastic. When she looked up, she was met with the friendly face of a young man about six feet tall. Her shortness, magnified by the fact that she was crouching, made her feel far inferior against his gigantic build. Despite the intimidation of that, there was a look about him that looked soft yet very masculine as well. &quot;Can't let a girl do the heavy work now, can we?&quot; He said, directing at the driver who just rolled his eyes and grunted unpleasantly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Uh, thanks,&quot; she said afterwards. She was truly grateful for his help yet she couldn't help but think that he must have harbored other motives. &quot;Okay, if you think I am going to give you a fee for that, sorry to disappoint you, but that's not going to happen.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Her straightforward declaration earned a moment of silence as an exchange of looks was passed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Then, the stranger broke into laughter. &quot;No, no, no,&quot; he squeezed out, trying his best to sound polite. It was as though what she said was so amusing. &quot;That was far from what I was thinking. You see, I like to help others out of the goodness of my heart. Nothing less, nothing more.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now, it was her turn to eye him suspiciously, her cynicism sparing him no chance. &quot;Do I look as stupid as you seem to think I am?&quot; Gillian questioned.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>He seemed to have taken her statement in jest because he just chuckled lamely. Gillian was wondering if there was something wrong with the guy's brain. What, did she look insane or something, too?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Hey, I didn't mean that,&quot; the stranger said, surprised. &quot;Look... I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression. Hey, why don't I help you give a ride or something? Or would you rather we get something to eat first?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Oh, well, speaking of which, Gillian was quite famished, longing for food the moment she boarded off the plane. She could literally hear her stomach growling impatiently inside. Great, now he woke up her appetite. That was for sure.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But then, again, he seemed like he was flirting. Her eyes widened in unmistakable horror. &quot;Don't you dare--&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The stranger rebutted immediately, as though sensing her insecurity. &quot;I mean no harm, really! I just wanna be friends.&quot; He was eyeing her with an intensity she didn't like. &quot;By the way, are you new here or something?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;None of your damn business,&quot; Gillian snapped harshly and grabbed her luggage. &quot;Thank you for your help, Mr. I-think-I'm-so-Cute-Flirting-Like-a-Lame-O!&quot; Shooting him a last glare, she began storming away, pulling the luggage behind with her.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>She did not walk two meters before she heard his voice again. &quot;By the way, my name is Daniel Wu!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It was then she felt her lungs collapsed, her body wobbling like a colt. No, it can't be...</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>She stopped.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>***********</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Edison Chen sat in his new Mercedes Benz, his face drained of color with the hints of boredom. The same song was playing for the fifth time by now and yet not a trace of his friend to be found. When that bastard was back, he was going to give him a piece of his mind. No one made Edison Chen wait like this. No one!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Speaking of Mr. Devil himself, Daniel Wu appeared at the side in a blink of an eye, a goofy grin lighting up his face. He waved a silly hi, a gesture so like him, and mounted onto the car.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;What the hell took you so long?&quot; Edison asked with irritation slacking his jaw. &quot;A minute too late, and I'll think you'd eloped with Jessica.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Pul-lease,&quot; Daniel said with a roll of his eyes. His friend's wild imagination never ceased to irritate the living bugs out of him. &quot;That would be the last thing I'll do. Next to getting married, of course.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>All signs of frustration dispersed as Edison embarked on conversation-mode. &quot;You're damn right about that! Gosh, women are peeves. The moment I fall in love with them, pigs will be able to fly.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Oh shut up, you lame-o,&quot; said Daniel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;You shut up,&quot; Edison snapped quickly. &quot;And since when do you use words like 'lame-o'? Isn't that a bit too... 'immature' for you?&quot; Edison laughed as he air quoted the word with his fingers for extra emphasis. True, Daniel had always been the wiser out of the two of them. Compared to Edison, Daniel was more, well, sophisticated. He had always topped the list in terms of academics, so unlike Edison, who had a record of failing his classes like an unstoppable epidemic disease. They might appear whales apart in personality, but women-wise, they shared the same sentiments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Daniel's mind zoned in thoughts as he recalled his meeting with the woman stranger. It was then to his realization how much of an influence she had on him. &quot;Nothing. Someone just called me that today, so it kind of got stuck in my head.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Who? A woman?&quot; The eagerness came out as a surprise as Edison gawked with incredulity. When Daniel confirmed with a nod, Edison laughed and teased, &quot;Uh oh! You're breaking your ground rules, man. You're falling for a girl!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Never in his life had Daniel been fond of a girl but when Edison mentioned it, he got to admit, the young woman he met earlier was sure something he couldn't really figure out.&nbsp; There was something vague about her that enticed him, yet it made her seem unattainable in a way. What are you thinking? Daniel quickly retreated from his thoughts. It was odd because it was a given fact that he had never felt that way toward a woman before.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;I am NOT,&quot; Daniel said sternly. &quot;Not now. Not ever. Stop talking.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Whatever, that's like impossible, man,&quot; said Edison. &quot;Knowing me, I'll keep talking until the second I drop dead.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Yeah, unfortunately,&quot; mumbled Daniel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Edison revived the engine. &quot;Okie dokes, here we go. Where were we heading again?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Just go straight home. Take a left here. How many times do I have to repeat myself?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;All right, man. No need to get all moody-woody with me.&quot; Edison made a turn but then a shadow suddenly appeared in front of him and gave him a scare. His heart lurched a mile as he saw the figure apparently not moving out of the lane. Quickly hitting the brakes, Edison turned over as the car roared into a stop. &quot;What is she, crazy?&quot; He mused out loud, apparently disgruntled.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The figure approached the car in a stride too unlady-like, pulling what seemed like a huge luggage behind her.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;You know, next time when you want to suicide, pick a better place. Best if it's desolated or something so you won't drag others down with you,&quot; Edison said sarcastically with fake humor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>She was huffing in pants. &quot;You...&quot; she said, losing her breath.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;What bloody hell do you want?&quot; He fired crudely, the displeasure never leaving the arch of his eyebrows. The moment he saw her face, he decided that he wasn't going to pretend to be nice. That plain girl thought she was so cool to block off his road like that?!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Hey, we meet again.&quot; The flare of recognition propelled Daniel forward as he bestowed her a knowing smile, his voice cheery. Then he frowned, remembering how they departed in bitter terms. &quot;Look, I didn't mean to offend your earlier--&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Hey, what are you doing?&quot; Edison asked as Daniel paused in his sentence. They were watching as the girl stalked to the side and broke open the car, throwing her belongings into the backseats. Much to their utter shock, she hopped inside like she had every right to do so and slammed the door.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;I'm coming with you,&quot; she said.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Edison and Daniel exchanged looks, and then the former burst out in raucous laughter. &quot;Oh man, you're crazy, right?&quot; Edison said in barely concealed humor. &quot;Sorry, little one, we ain't nobody's mommies.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Shut up. I wasn't talking to you,&quot; she snapped and shot him the finger, much to his outrage. She turned to Daniel. &quot;I thought you are a nice guy that is willing to help others out of the goodness and kindness of his heart? Well prove it.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Dude, he does not have to prove anything--&quot; Edison began but was rudely cut off again.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;I am getting chased down by a gang of stupid dogs, and unless you help to carry me the hell out of this place, I'm going to be supper for them tonight.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Edison laughed, the ridiculousness of the story grating his nerves to no end. &quot;You think we're going to buy that line of bullshit?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>She had noticed that the idiot had a tendency to butt into the conversation and could only give him the eye. The following seconds were simply a torture for her as she anticipated desperately for the other guy's response. Oh please, say yes, she thought. You must.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Let's go,&quot; said Daniel. &quot;Come on, Edison, hit the car.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;You have got to be off your fucking box--&quot; Edison paused, sensing the dark, electric waves from his friend. It would be stupid of him to go against the guy at this point but his mind resisted. &quot;Dude! What if she's a robber or something?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Daniel rolled his eyes. &quot;Don't be ridiculous. We should try and help the needy. What's the big deal?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Big deal is you seem to be smitten by a witch curse,&quot; Edison mumbled when Daniel shot him a weird look. &quot;Nothing, nothing. Just don't come crying to me later on.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Daniel turned back to Gillian, a bit nervous. &quot;Sorry about that. My friend is a bit... whacko.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;I heard that!&quot; Edison hissed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Gillian flashed a smile in return. &quot;Don't worry about it. I have worked in an asylum before and surely have seen people far worse than him.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Are you implying that I am--&quot; Edison began, his eyes enlarged at the girl's guts to dare make such implications. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Keep your eyes on the road!&quot; Daniel scolded from the side.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Edison could not but have to comply, for crashing into a pole or a building was the last thing he wanted to happen. He had to swallow his unpleasant grumbling and suppress the rising ire.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Relief exploded inside Gillian's chest as the car resumed its engine. She was nervous like hell. That blabbering idiot did nothing to help either. Why couldn't he just shut up? As far as she knew, he seemed like one heartless, mean, whatever jerk. Okay, so maybe her lazy excuse of &quot;getting chased down by a gang of stupid dogs&quot; was a little forced, but come on, who wouldn't pity a girl who had to go as far as fetching that kind of excuse?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But on the bright side, at least the Daniel guy wasn't all that jerkish. She was beginning to have second thoughts about him in fact. Daniel Wu... The familiarity of that name rang loudly in her ears. She damn well knew who he was. And hell, she was glad that she'd found him.</div>
