<div>Chapter Six</div>
<div>&nbsp;New Roommate?</div></center>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>************</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After the disastrous event at the restaurant, Gillian decided that it was the final straw. No way in hell could she endure a whole semester dorming with someone as hysterical and obnoxious as the infamous camp belle Ruby Lin. The so-called cat fight was outrageously absurd and Gillian had never imagined herself to be entangled in such thing. With Ruby Lin, however, it sort of made sense why and how she lost the chunk of her sanity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So she did the smartest thing she could think of. She requested for a room change.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Her aunt would certainly approve of her request if given a good reason. And with connections, of course the task could be done smoothly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Later that week, she was sorted to move into a dormitory in the South Wing. Her mood was in soaring high in clouds at the thought she was given peace at last.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Ten minutes passed as Gillian marched around campus, trying to look for her dormitory but the endless courtyard was draining her patience. Why did this place have to be so huge and confusing?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Look, I think there's a lost birdie here,&quot; Kenny's voice echoed behind her.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Gillian turned around and saw Kenny and Takeshi together. Knowing that they belonged to Ruby's gang, she groaned inwardly and was about to dash off to avoid unnecessary troubles.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Takeshi stopped her, however. &quot;Tsk, tsk, tsk! If it isn't the endearing drama queen!&quot; Takeshi greeted her with a kooky look. Then he bestowed her a devlish smile that she thought was odd of him. Like, seriously, did they even know each other? &quot;What's the rush? We're not ghosts or anything.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Well, she certainly thinks we are,&quot; Kenny commented. &quot;Just look at her face. Come on, leave her alone.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Nuh uh! A gentleman like me cannot stand to see a helpless lady getting lost and not help,&quot; Takeshi declared seriously. &quot;Where are you heading to, sweetie?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;The South Wing,&quot; Gillian replied and then grimaced. &quot;And I'm not your sweetie.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;That's harsh,&quot; said Takeshi, clutching at his heart.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Kenny elbowed him. &quot;Oh stop it, you big head. Just hurry up and help her. I don't have all day.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So the threesome roamed around campus for a bit, stewing in silence for the most part until Takeshi spoke up. &quot;Hey... you know, Edison bunks in the South Wing, too. Perhaps you two might have a chance to be roommates!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The slightest idea of even being in proximity with Edison churned her stomach with acid. That was the last thing she wanted to happen, for who could foresee what disaster might befall on them? They were almost like fire and ice. Not one time did they speak to each other without engaging into a fiery bicker or exchange of insults. She was already too tired of him.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;God, don't even remind me of someone as incorrigable as him!&quot; Gillian declared.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Such strong reaction shocked both Kenny and Takeshi as they dwelled in the possibilities. &quot;Don't tell us you guys--&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Gillian's eyes widened at their despicable implication. &quot;No, nothing like that! I'll be dead before I succumb to his claws.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Oh, well, that makes sense,&quot; said Takeshi. &quot;Knowing Edison, he would never fall for a woman, even if they might be as cute as you.&quot; It was true. Edison was known for being the number one womanizer but behind it all lied the number one woman-hater. For some odd reason, the guy thought little of women which explained his tendency to toy with their feelings and ditch them afterwards. He wasn't heartless but those women's staining claws forced him to be. Perhaps, that was why he was always misunderstood and taken as the playboy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Kenny nudged the other guy with slight annoyance. &quot;It's not time to flirt, big head.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;You're the one with the big head!&quot; Takeshi retorted. &quot;My head is just the right size,&quot; he bragged. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Kenny rolled his eyes. &quot;I was talking about your ego.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Two and a half minutes later, Gillian stood in front of her new room. She inhaled a deep breath, thanking God for a second chance for peace. No matter what, she was going to find it this time. No more annoying headaches. No more loud bitches. Most importantly, no more Ruby.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>God was cruel, however, because as soon as she saw Edison sprawled on the couch inside the common room, her mood dunked down to the lowest peaks.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;See? What did I tell you?&quot; This came from Takeshi.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Shut up, no one asked you,&quot; Kenny told him.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Edison shot up from his position, a look of disbelief shown on his face. &quot;Oh no...&quot; He gasped with an obvious horror. &quot;Oh fucking no...&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hello? It wasn't like she was all pleased to see him here either. &quot;Why, yes, Chen. I am your supposedly new roommate from now on.&quot; She flashed him forced smile, the sight of him grossing out strangely entertaining.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;See! I knew it! You're a witch!&quot; Edison accused dramatically with a bobbing finger in the air. &quot;Haven't you caused enough troubles for me? God! I must have done something horrible in my past life to have deserved this!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Be cool there!&quot; Takeshi interrupted as he set the luggage down. &quot;Don't forget that you're roommates now.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>At the mention of that, however, both of their faces darkened.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Yes, that's right, Chen,&quot; said Gillian with another fake smile. She figured that it was even funner to see him so pissed off while she remained adamantly calm. Between the two of them, he was clearly the one that suffered more. &quot;Anyway, I'm heading upstairs to my room now. See you all tomorrow morning.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When she left, Takeshi flew over to Edison's side, curiosity beating his brain. &quot;Ahem. Details please?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Edison rolled his eyes in extreme annoyance. &quot;For what?&quot; he hissed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Duh! How you got the attention of a hot lady with one hell of a personality!&quot; Takeshi singsonged.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There was a look of incredulity that molded his face as Edison suppressed the urge to laugh out loud. &quot;You're kidding me, right? How can you ever think of her as hot? Not to mention, she's a damned witch causing troubles everywhere she goes. You've seen it, haven't you?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Yeah but are you sure you're not up to court her or something??&quot; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Edison suddenly remembered the task he picked up out of the goodness of a friend's heart. He WAS supposed to be courting Gillian to fend Daniel off her evil claws. Edison still could not believe that Gillian did not seem a bit bothered about the fact that her own brother was fawning over her like crazy. Disgusting, anyone?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Um, who said I'm not? I am, so don't you even think about it!&quot; Edison quickly rebuked, smoking out fire as he drilled the warning into Takeshi's head. &quot;Let me warn you, my friend. You're a good guy, aren't you? With good qualities? Yeah I know. So I was thinking you wouldn't have such bad taste as me, right?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Takeshi laughed with amusing eyes. &quot;Oh come on, Edison, did you just drink poison or something? The Edison I know wouldn't crap-talk himself that way.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Whatever! I'm spell-bound, okay?! Now move! I'm going to take a shower.&quot; Edison threw the book he had in his hands at Takeshi and fled off.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Takeshi caught it with grace. &quot;Tell me, isn't that guy nuts?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;If you ask me, you're the crazy one here,&quot; Kenny said.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>*************</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Gillian was out in the courtyard for fresh air when she caught a glimpse of Edison sneaking out of the dorm. His stiffened movements told her that he was up to no good and her instincts swayed her body to tail after him.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>They were snaking around the campus for god knows how long when finally Edison stopped in front of the screening room. What could he be doing there? Batches of questions were swimming around her mind and if she didn't feed her brain the answers, it might explode. With careful footsteps so she would not bust herself, she followed him inside.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There she saw Daniel inside too. Perhaps he was studying after the class.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Wait... That meant... Why the hell was Edison sneaking out just to see Daniel?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;God, I was looking everywhere for you!&quot; exclaimed Edison exasperately as he stalked to the table. His mind was running with things to say. He had to let it out, he had to. &quot;Look, I have something important to tell you. It's been bothering me for a long time and I figured it might be best if I tell it now.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Daniel turned away from the screen, a look of confusion stamped on his face. &quot;What's so urgent that can't be saved for tomorrow? I still have an assignment to finish before class tomorrow.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Well, fuck that shit,&quot; Edison said bluntly and ran a hand through his hair. &quot;This stuff is way more urgent than your damned assignment. I am going to explode and go crazy if I don't let this out.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When Edison was speaking to you that way, you have got to believe whatever he said was going to be pretty damn serious. Daniel turned off the film and pushed aside his notes. &quot;Okay, Edison. Attention all on you now.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Did you know that Gillian just moved into my dorm?&quot; Edison asked.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;What? No way!&quot; Daniel exclaimed with sheer surprise and dread. That meant that Edison would have a better chance of courting Gillian and if anything, Daniel felt heated. &quot;Did you do it on purpose or something? Like abuse your powers as a rich boy and have things your way? Well, let me tell you, you're being unreasonable and unfair. I thought we agreed that this was going to be a fair competition? We're bothing courting Gillian!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Her eyes widened tremendously as the words surged out of Daniel's mouth. Gillian could not believe... Oh my god, so this was what their silly agreement was about? Daniel did not know that she was his sister, so maybe that part was understandable, but Edison? Her mind contorted into lines. That was impossible!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Edison rolled his eyes. &quot;I'm not finished yet, you dork!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;You know, I'm getting so sick of you playing cunning!&quot; Outrage gave way to anger as Daniel lost his control. &quot;I thought we were friends. But it turns out, you're planning things behind my back!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Obviously, the guy had lost his sense about this girl. Edison had never seen him so crazy about a girl before. How sad it was that the first girl he ever was serious about turned out to be his sister! Ironic! Funny! Hi-la-rious!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;You stupid, mother-effing moron. She's your damned si--&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Guys! What's going on?&quot; Gillian had to rush to stop Edison from blurting out her secret. Her nerves were shaking terribly and her heart was pounding against her ribs ruthlessly. She did not know why she was so scared, so afraid to let Daniel learn that she was actually his sister. Maybe she would be rejected? Maybe he wouldn't accept her as a sister? Such idea was frightening because to be honest, she had already grown to like Daniel as a brother, even when he was completely clueless about the whole ordeal. Still, she did not want the secret out yet. Not yet. It would only ruin her plans.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Edison's eyes were colored in shock. &quot;Where the hell did you come from?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>She bore into his eyes with an intensity so deep that she knew he felt the shudders. &quot;Oh, I saw someone sneaking around like a shameless thief and assumed that he must be up to no good. Of course, if I were a second late, who knows what bullshit might surge out from his mouth?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Hey, I'm only trying to tell him the fucking tru--&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Hi Gil!&quot; Daniel totally dropped the fiery demeanor and plastered on a cheerful face. &quot;Are you here to visit me?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Why, yes,&quot; Gillian said sweetly. Edison's veins bulged even further. &quot;Look, I don't feel comfortable here. Why don't we head out and have a cup of coffee?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Ahem. Campus is closed after 7 PM, you know,&quot; Edison said with restraint.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Daniel rolled his eyes. &quot;Don't try to stop me from going out with Gil.&quot; He took a quick glance at his watch to make sure it really wasn't seven. &quot;And it's 6:48.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;What's the difference?&quot; Edison asked. &quot;As if you guys can do much in twelve minutes.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Why, every minute is precious!&quot; Gillian interjected with a smirk. She figured it was the bast tactice to rescue Daniel from Edison's seemingly scheming self. How dared he tried to spill out her secret? Was it any of his fucking business? &quot;Come on, Daniel.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Edison watched with disbelief as the two hooked arms and skedaddled away.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>*************</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;So Daniel...&quot; Gillian was saying as she stirred her coffee cup in a stride that spoke of her troubled mind. &quot;Umm.. do you have a family?&quot; It was time to fish out some answers. She had been wasting too much time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Oh, yes. Yes I do,&quot; replied Daniel a bit too overly hyped. Butterflies were flapping inside his stomach. It was, after all, the first time he was alone with Gillian. &quot;I have a dad, a step-mom--&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Gillian's ears perked up. &quot;A what?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;A dad, a stepmom--&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Stepmom?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Yes.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There was a taut line that straightened her lips. &quot;Oh... How about your real mom?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;She's...&quot; Daniel couldn't find the words to explain. &quot;To be honest, I don't even think I know who she is.&quot; There was a gloomy look on his face but before Gillian could persist to ask further, he swapped the topics. &quot;So why did you decide to come to Hong Kong?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Gillian didn't know how to answer. She just couldn't say that she came back was because of him. &quot;Oh, um, my mom died recently, so I decided to move here with my aunt.&quot; It was true, and Gillian was relieved that she didn't have to live with another lie. &quot;Um.. Say... how about I meet your family?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The request was strange, she knew, but she was completely desperate to meet the rest of her family and find out what really happened. This was her only chance. She didn't care if Daniel was judging her.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In truth, Daniel was as amused as ever. Did that mean that she was accepting him? The idea triggered a burst of joy to erupt inside him as confidence came knocking him in the head. &quot;Oh um, sure! That would be great! Hell, why don't we host a pool party while we're at it?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Gillian's mind sparked. Yes, that would help to make her motives less obvious. &quot;Deal.&quot;</div>
