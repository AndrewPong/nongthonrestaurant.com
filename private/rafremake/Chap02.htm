<p><span style='color:black'>Chapter Two: <b>Busted! Newfound Discovery<br>
-<o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Hello, someone needs to tell me where to
go,&quot; <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> was saying, <span
class=SpellE>irritance</span> leaking through his words. &quot;I've been
driving for awhile now but I don't even know where the hell I'm heading
to.&quot; He flicked a glance at Gillian through the rear mirror. Anyone could
sense the barefaced dislike he harbored in those luminous eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>His indirect scorn made Gillian's skin itch with
repulsion. Had she not owe him a favor, she would have fought him verbally.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Oh, I'm so sorry.&quot; Her tone sounded
phony, but she wasn't about to stoop that low and actually expend an effort to
sound sincere to a motherless bastard like him. &quot;Why didn't you say so
earlier? It wasn't my intention to take up your precious time and waste your
precious gas.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Daniel, who was oblivious to the rising tension
between the <span class=GramE>duo</span>, intervened. &quot;Hey, what's your
name? I believe we haven't had proper introductions.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Her eyes sparked. &quot;The name's Gillian Chung.
Yes, I'm sort of new here, so forgive me if I say anything that might offend
you, because you know I tend to talk--&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Too much?&quot; <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>
filled in for her with a sneer. He peered at her detestably through the rear
mirror. &quot;Well, that's certainly a surprise.&quot; Sarcasm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>She flashed a forced smile but in actuality, her
fists were clenching in annoyance. &quot;Your turn,&quot; she reminded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ed,&quot; he replied, composed. His eyes
bore straight at the road without a glance at her. &quot;But you see that's
what close friends call me. As for you, I'd appreciate it if you just stick to
something as polite-sounding as Mr. Chen.&quot; There was a short pause, as
though he was repeating those words in his head. &quot;Hey, it actually sounds
pretty cool. Mr. Chen.&quot; He said it with a suave tone, actually liking the
authorative sound of the name.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Gillian had to fight the urge to roll her eyes at
his ridiculousness and childishness. &quot;Oh, all right then... Chen.&quot;
The pause was deliberate, in a mock to his. Delight thrummed her veins when she
saw his jaw clenched.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Mr. Chen,&quot; he corrected bluntly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Puzzlement usurped Daniel's face in a way it made
him look distorted. &quot;Is it me, or do I feel that you guys don't really
like each other?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>How true that was. The fact was, the moment she
laid eyes on <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>, Gillian had jumped into
rash conclusions that he was a mean asshole with a foul mouth. Furthermore, the
way he talked and acted just simply peeved her to no end. Call it hate at first
sight. Like in the real world, there are always people that you will like at
first glance, but there are also those that you will hate. There are those that
you like from the start but will hate in the end. Likewise, those you hate may
be the ones you will grow to appreciate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><st1:place w:st="on"><span style='color:black'>Edison</span></st1:place><span
style='color:black'> belonged to the group that she hated from the very start.
The chance of she changing her opinion seemed just as improbable as it was
impossible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;And you're Daniel Wu...&quot; Gillian said,
avoiding his directed input. &quot;As in the son of Adam Wu?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>There was no hint of surprise that tinted his
eyes. &quot;Um, yes,&quot; he said with an admirable politeness she had to
credit him for. Not many can carry such manners. Ahem, like the one sitting
next to him. &quot;You know my dad?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>She felt her muscles tensed uncontrollably as she
fought for the courage to whip out an appropriate and reasonable reply.
&quot;Of course not. I just heard, that's all.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>A flicker of doubt shone in <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>'s
eyes. &quot;How is that so? Didn't you say you're new here?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Her reflex was quick. &quot;Well yes, but I just
heard about him this morning when I boarded off the plane. Some lady was
talking about him. Famous, no?&quot; She gulped fretfully. Even she had to
wince at that sorry excuse. &quot;Anyway... Maybe you guys can drop me off at
the motel, if that works.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span class=GramE><span style='color:black'>&quot;Motel?&quot;</span></span><span
style='color:black'> Daniel arched an eyebrow. &quot;Those places aren't very
safe for someone like you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;What a homeless girl to do?&quot; Gillian
asked in an innocent tone. &quot;Ahh, if only I could afford to live in the
states... I would've stayed...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><st1:place w:st="on"><span style='color:black'>Edison</span></st1:place><span
style='color:black'> rolled his eyes at her fake tone. Too bad Daniel seemed to
think otherwise. &quot;Don't worry about it,&quot; Daniel assured like a
gentleman. &quot;In fact, why don't we help you move into a refined hotel
instead? We'll pay for your expenses.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Sure, Edison knew his friend was pretty naive
given that he was a rich boy and had never really experienced the horrors of
life, not to mention the boundless kindness of his big heart, but there has got
to be a limit to a man's stupidity. <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> was
beginning to think his friend might be swinging a little crush on the stranger.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Shudder. He thought. Just shudder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Whoa, whoa!&quot; <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>
exclaimed in dramatic exaggeration that made Gillian roll her eyes. &quot;You
want to help her, but don't drag me down the pothole.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Come on, don't be so petty. She can really
use both of our help.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>There was a snort of disagreement. Gillian could
clearly see the boundary of this man's generosity, and boy if it wasn't shocking.
&quot;I'd rather eat my money, than use it to help her. Like, seriously, did I
even hear a word of thanks for this trouble I didn't have to be involved in, in
the first place?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Gillian realized it was time to put an input.
&quot;Look, guys, I don't hope to bring troubles. I'll be fine stuck in a
regular motel. I thank you for your offer, but it's not necessary. I'm not that
poor to the state I can't even afford a room. Beside, my aunt lives in <st1:place
w:st="on">Hong Kong</st1:place>. I'm planning to stay over hers after I settle
down... a bit.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Yeah, you heard her,&quot; <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>
said lazily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Daniel was still persistent to help. &quot;Okay,
fine, if you're so stingy, I'll help her out myself. Pull yourself together and
start the damn car.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Gillian would protest but then the more she
thought about it, the more the idea appealed to her. Beside, wouldn't it be too
rude to reject him even further when he was so sincere and inclined to help? In
the end, she graciously accepted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><st1:place w:st="on"><span style='color:black'>Edison</span></st1:place><span
style='color:black'> shook his head to the side. Stupid, mother-effing idiot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>**************<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><st1:place w:st="on"><span style='color:black'>Edison</span></st1:place><span
style='color:black'> slammed the luggage on the floor once they reached the
hotel room, bearing no respect or even an ounce of patience. Hell, he wouldn't
even help her carry the luggage in the first place if Daniel hadn't begged him
to while he scuttled off somewhere to buy this ungrateful imp some dinner!
Hell, <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> wouldn't even succumb to
anybody's begging if it weren't for his own suspicion of this little girl that
made him want to interrogate her. And he couldn't do that if Daniel were
there...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>So...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>This was the perfect time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Are you even a man?&quot; Gillian bore no
restraint as she shot him the question, referring to his uncivilized act of
throwing her property around as if he had every single right in the whole world
to do so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Look, it's only me and you here so you can
quit your acting, little lady,&quot; <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>
started. &quot;Don't think you are so smart. My experienced eyes can see
through you like an invisible glass. You're here for some hidden agenda, aren't
you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Gillian
hissed and backed away. &quot;Daniel wanted to help me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>He snorted with derision, a gesture she didn't
appreciate. &quot;Yeah. First you got run down by a gang of wolves. Then, you
know about that Adam Wu thingy, and then the staying at the motel excuse to
take advantage of Daniel. Sounds kind of forced, don't you think?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>His condemning tone sliced every inch of her
tolerance and drained most of her patience. &quot;Hey, I'm just telling the
truth. Can't help it if you don't believe me. Now excuse me, I have to unpack
my stuff?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Yeah, as if I'm going to believe in your
bullshit,&quot; <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> spat. It surprised her
how mean he was turning into. Initially, she thought he was just an immature
boy but he proved to be more than what just meets the eye. &quot;Sorry, I'm not
as gullible as Dan is.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Just what the fuck is your problem?&quot;
Out of tactics, Gillian resorted to profanity. He thought he could disrespect
her like that? &quot;Ever since we meet, you're just continuously bitching at
me and going against everything I do!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Yeah, maybe we're destined to be enemies.
How cool is that?&quot; said <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> with fake
humor. &quot;I'll tell you what my problem is: What I hate most is people
lying, especially if that happens to my friends. I don't know what your
intention is, but if you're planning to hurt Dan, you're messing with the wrong
dude.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>She rolled her eyes in irritation. &quot;Is that
supposed to be a threat, Chen? Wow, I actually thought you were more than
that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Oh shut up. You think you're so great?&quot;
<st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> shot back. &quot;It's Mr. Chen,&quot;
he corrected.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;You're just as immature and as stupid as a
five-year-old, so I do not need to address you with that kind of respect,&quot;
Gillian said sharply. &quot;Chen.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>The usual stubborn <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>
wasn't going to succumb that easily. Pride and anger gave way to impulsiveness
as he dashed forward where her luggage lay open and grabbed her passport.
&quot;You know what; I'm going to send you back to where you come from.
Wherever in hell that is.&quot; He flipped open her passport and as his eyes
read the bold letters of her name, his mind contorted into a world of squiggly
lines. &quot;What? Wu Yan Tong? I thought you said your last name was
Chung?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>She snatched it back. &quot;You do not intrude
people's privacy like that, you moron!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;I knew it. You, you definitely have some
sort of hidden agenda shoved in your sleeves. You know what; I'm not leaving
until I find out what your motive is.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>His obstinacy sickened her to a degree she could
not withstand. &quot;Don't make me get physical,&quot; she threatened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;God, I'm like, so scared,&quot; <st1:place
w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> shrieked with sarcasm dripping his words.
&quot;Puny girl like you is no match for me, so give it up. What's your damn
agenda, huh?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;None of your concern, okay?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><st1:place w:st="on"><span style='color:black'>Edison</span></st1:place><span
style='color:black'>'s mind took a stroll. Wu Yang Tong, where had he heard of
such name? The familiarity of the name pounded inside his head as he struggled
to fetch for answers. Wu Yang Tong. That was it! Memories came swimming back in
only an instant. &quot;Shit! That's impossible! You can't be...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Gillian's eyes widened in horror at the prospect
that he knew. At this rate, she could not run, she could not avoid, and
definitely she could not lie. Her nerves shook&nbsp;in anxiety as she searched
for something to say. &quot;I...&quot; What else was there to say? The look in
his eyes already divulged his newfound discovery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><st1:place w:st="on"><span style='color:black'>Edison</span></st1:place><span
style='color:black'> was torn in words. He had heard numerous references about
Wu Yan Tong and was sure that this was no sick coincidence. Yet he couldn't
assume it was true until he gets the answer from her mouth. &quot;Are you his
sis--&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;So what if I am?&quot; Gillian harshly spat.
&quot;It's none of your damn business! So let me tell you! You had better keep
your mouth shut or else--&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Or what? You'll pound me to death?&quot; <st1:place
w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;No! I will chop you to death!&quot; She
pushed him out of her way. Bad move. Bad bad move. Who ever knew this guy was
as weak and rootless as a feather? He crashed into the cabinet behind her with
a loud slam! But no, that wasn't it. He had to, he just had to stumble forward,
trip over the lifeless luggage and tumble towards her way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>And no, that still wasn't it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>He HAD to choose--well, not really choose- to fall
over her. Gillian let out a yelp as time froze for one millisecond as matrix
exaggerated and spun around in three dimensional mode before the both of them
crashed onto the mattress with an OOOF!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><st1:place w:st="on"><span style='color:black'>Edison</span></st1:place><span
style='color:black'> stared into their eyes. They were warped into a world that
no longer was reality as they sauntered through each other's eyes. <st1:place
w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> didn't know what he was feeling but god he felt as
if he was just immersed into an ocean as he stared at her; waves and waves
overlapped as he fell into a deep abyss impossible to climb out. And then,
those luscious red lips, the smooth skin, all beckoned his whole attention--<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Get off of me!&quot; Gillian shrieked,
snapping him out of his reverie. <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>'s eyes
regained their normality as he realized what awkward position he was in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Crap, my shirt!&quot; <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>
cried when he hopped up, only to find that the button of his dress shirt was
entangled with her sweater.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Okay, so not only was his button got tangled with
her sweater, but it seemed as though it got stuck at the wrong place! &quot;You
pervert! Get your hands off of me!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Uh yeah, as if I'm not trying!&quot; <st1:place
w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> retorted back with weighty sarcasm as he tried to
pry the button and yarn of her sweater apart. But she kept on moving that it was
nearly impossible to attempt at untying them. &quot;Can you not move?!&quot; <st1:place
w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> hissed with nil patience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Suddenly, they heard footsteps. Footsteps
approaching their room. The sight of them was almost unmentionable and oh my
god, what if it someone saw them this way? Ed's hand all over her-- Oh my God!
Gillian couldn't let her image defer like this. She was a girl full of pride
and self esteem and she would never let anyone catch her in such an improper
position, and not to mention it must be Daniel, her brother!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Gillian pushed <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>
away and rolled onto the floor, in the process, tearing her sweater.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Edison looked at Gillian in bafflement before
registering what just happened and shoved his hand behind him, where a piece of
her sweater still hung onto his button.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Hey--&quot; Daniel stopped short in his
sentence, seeing <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> standing like a
scarecrow. &quot;Where's Gillian?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Oh, I'm here!&quot; Gillian popped her head
up from behind the bed and pulled a bright, but fake smile. &quot;I'm just
uh... shoving my luggage under the bed.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Daniel nodded with acknowledgement. &quot;Here, I
bought you some food from across the street. Edison and I have to get home now.
But if you need help, just feel free to call me anytime,&quot; he said, giving
her his phone number, in which Gillian insisted that he just put on the night
desk. &quot;Come <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>, let's go.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><st1:place w:st="on"><span style='color:black'>Edison</span></st1:place><span
style='color:black'> trailed after Daniel. But he didn't leave the room before
shooting Gillian a questioning look. <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>
didn't know why she didn't tell Daniel that she was his sister. God, never
would he imagine that she'd be the little Miss Gillian he'd heard about! Her
mother was a tramp, as people said. No wonder her daughter was uncivil and
rude, and ungrateful, and just totally intolerable like this!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><st1:place w:st="on"><span style='color:black'>Edison</span></st1:place><span
style='color:black'> hopped into the driver's seat as Daniel amounted on the
other side. <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> studied Daniel's
expression. He was smiling like a complete idiot! What the hell?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Hey are you feeling like donating some
million dollars to the charity?&quot; <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>
asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Daniel gazed at his friend. &quot;How'd you
know?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Uh duh! Because a fairy god mother told
me!&quot; <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> said sarcastically with a
roll of his eyes. &quot;Dude! Don't tell me you're liking a girl whom you
didn't even meet for half a day?!&quot; <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>
wanted to spill out the beans, but remembering Gillian's threatening eyes made
him jump back in consideration. He was always one who had integrity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>So he couldn't spill it out. At least, not yet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Daniel
asked outrageously, putting <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> in relief.
Phew. So he really didn't-- &quot;We did know her for half a day!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><st1:place w:st="on"><span style='color:black'>Edison</span></st1:place><span
style='color:black'> slapped his forehead. He had hoped that Daniel was denying
it. At least that would be better, but no! It appeared as if Daniel was deeper
in the hole than he first thought! &quot;Dude, you can't--&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;Don't tell me you're interested in
her?&quot; Daniel shot <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> a pair of killer
eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>&quot;You have got to be fucking kidding--&quot; <st1:place
w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> paused as a revelation hit him hard and square.
Crap! Daniel really liked her! But she was his sister! And he was her brother!
That mean<span class=GramE>..</span> <span class=GramE>That mean</span>... if
they went out... and got married... and had kids... &quot;What? <span
class=GramE>Of course!&quot;</span> <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>
revoked his initial disgust and slapped on a feigned serious face. &quot;She's
gorgeous! Let me tell you! I'm courting her! So you--back off!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Whoa. That certainly came out as a surprise. But <st1:place
w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> kept in mind that he said those things because he
wanted to push his friend away from the wrong path and not because he really
meant it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Daniel gazed at <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>
in utter disbelief. &quot;I met her first. It made no sense if I'm the one
backing off and not you,&quot; he stated calmly. &quot;Well, I'm not surprised.
Gillian is really gorgeous. I don't blame you if you love her at first sight.
Good stuff gets competition you know? So if you like her, then let me tell you,
work hard. <span class=GramE>Because I'm going to snatch her away from you real
bad if you don't.&quot;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Okay, so maybe she wasn&#8217;t that bad, but come
on! She was as shrewd as a witch can be! No way will he ever like such a gross
girl!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><st1:place w:st="on"><span style='color:black'>Edison</span></st1:place><span
style='color:black'> wanted to retort back. Damn, he should have just told
Daniel the truth! But now, it was too late. He couldn't let Daniel fall into a
tragic doom. <span class=GramE>No way, no how.</span> Not when he could help
it. Even if it meant sacrifice, then so be it, <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>
will court that Gillian Chung.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>For Daniel's sake, he had to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
