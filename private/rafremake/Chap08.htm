<div>Chapter Eight</div>
<div>Mega-Trouble</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>*</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Gillian, Edison, and Daniel were sitting in the same row consecutively. Gillian actually didn't want to sit next to the pighead since that memory still was vivid inside her head but Daniel had insisted that she sat with them lest the professor tried to pick on her again. She wasn't afraid of getting picked on; she was more afraid of sitting next to the jerk.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Daniel was supposed to sit next to Edison but he somehow disappeared from his side and appeared next to Gillian, such that she was now between them. Edison cast an annoyed glance at Daniel who only smiled back innocently.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Professor Joe Ma entered the classroom, his face fixed with blank solemnity as though the whole world owed him. &quot;Good morning, class. I had just finished through the process of grading all of your essays. Honestly speaking, I am truly disappointed and unsatisfied with every single one of them. None had gotten A marks. There were a lot of B's, C's, D's and an F...&quot; He continued to drone on about his standards and expectations. Everyone was eager to get their essay back, not to hear his monotonous voice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>At last, Joe Ma passed back all of the essays.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Gillian looked at hers, disappointment drowning inside her eyes. Edison peeked at her paper and snorted. &quot;At least I didn't get an F,&quot; he declared so as to annoy her.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Gillian could not believe it. In no way could she. Why was her paper the only òF'? She had put so many effort, time, and energy into it, why did she not get a 'D' at least? An F? Gillian's mood and enthusiasm dunked to the lowest. That one word was truly powerful.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Are there any questions regarding the grades?&quot; Joe Ma asked.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Gillian shot up from her seat instantly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Yes?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;I believe I don't deserve this F.&quot; Gillian solemnly stated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Oh so yours was the paper that was talking about philosophy isn't it?&quot; Joe Ma mocked.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Gillian gritted her teeth. &quot;It was obvious you didn't even take a considerate look over the essay when you marked this F!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;I didn't? But I remember clearly what it talked about. It yapped on and on and on about philosophy. How can I miss it?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Bull shit! Philosophy was only a small part in it. More specifically, the beginning! Obviously you didn't even bother to flick to the third page!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;This is a law class, not philosophy. Apparently it is your problem and your fault for not making the beginning clear or conveying enough about laws. I was reading it and I, for a second, thought the essay slipped into the bundle by accident!&quot; Joe Ma's words dripped with heavy taunt as he criticized her harshly. &quot;Not only you failed at the assignment, you failed at writing!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;This is unfair. Every essay has its own essence, and so does mine! It is clear that you are biased against me and hated my essay the moment you see the word philosophy!&quot; Gillian argued feverishly. The class watched with amusement as they had never seen such a stubborn and hotheaded girl.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;That is crap.&quot; Joe Ma refuted hotly. &quot;This is my class and I have the right to judge on an individual's work according to my opinion.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;The problem is: your opinion is too narrow-minded!&quot; Pissed off, Gillian could no longer hold it back. &quot;I have never seen such an imprudent professor like you who refuses to accept others' opinions, who refuses to encourage a student, and who refuses to act in justice! The funny irony here is that you are teaching law. Yet every thing about you is marked with injustice!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Gillian Chung! You shut your mouth right now!&quot; Joe Ma demanded, having half the urge to kick her out of his classroom.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;I am sorry but this is my opinion, and since you forced me to accept your petty one, you must accept mines!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;You do not speak to me like that!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;And you can belittle me like you're God? What world is this? Do I have to oblige to your every order?&quot; Gillian was out of control. Every anger, every resentment rushed to her veins like a coursing river, relentless and stormy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Daniel watched Gillian dreamily, loving her rebellious and stubborn attitude. The show seemed entertaining for Edison as he watched the girl with amusement. Gillian truly astounded him.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Get out of my classroom and don't ever appear again!&quot; Joe ordered, his veins threatened to pop. Flames flickered in his eyes as the humiliation sank into his bones.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;That would be my pleasure! I don't fancy the idea of staying in an unjustified classroom!&quot; Gillian shot back arrogantly. &quot;Who here agrees with me that Joe Ma is totally a loser who failed at his subject of teaching law? I mean, have you guys ever learned anything in this class besides monotonous rules that really don't even matter?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Nobody answered as they all glanced at each other. Honestly speaking, who the hell would go against the Professor Joe Ma when he was clearly the one who determines the grades? They didn't pay heaps of money to get into law school for nothing. Gillian's heart sank as she witnessed the nil support from her classmates.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Joe Ma smirked. Authority sure has it ways to greet easy victories. &quot;Miss Chung, It is clear that you are the only one who was dissatisfied with my cla--&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Yo Joe Ma! Count me in!&quot; Takeshi suddenly stood up from his seat, giving every one a shock. Usually he was the quiet one in the class. Because of his low confidence in academics, Takeshi never really participated or gave an effort. &quot;I really want to say this long ago, but you really sucks ass Joe Ma! And man, you gave my excellent, beyond miraculous, beautiful essay a freaking 'C'? It totally deserved an A+ and I don't know what the hell is wrong with your brain but I know you need to have it rechecked again before you decide to determine my extravagant essay a damn C!&quot; Gillian looked astonishingly at Takeshi. Was he kidding her? A C was a passing grade! Now that he was going against him, he surely will not pass at all! &quot;Come on, Gillian. You have my support!&quot;ù Takeshi pounded his chest encouragingly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;It appears to me that not only Gillian Chung is brainless, Mr. Takeshi&nbsp; is announcing his stupidity,&quot; Joe Ma smirked sinisterly as he glared at the class as if to demand them to give a chuckle.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Hey, at least we're not a jackass!&quot; Takeshi refuted. &quot;How dare you call the Takeshi Kaneshiro stupid. I'm pretty sure I am smarter and better looking than you could ever be!&quot; His arrogant side submerged. &quot;And it's really pitiful how you're attacking on a girl who's simply just trying to speak up her mind. Like is it a crime just trying? If you ask me, I say that Gillian could be a magnificent lawyer than you with your years of education and law degrees could ever be!!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There was a short silence. It was grating but it was obvious that pretty much everyone was quite bemused at the teacher's spectacular defeat.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>How could it be? Gillian thought. She and Takeshi were barely on friendly terms, and now he was backing her up? This guy was sure crazy but his guts and bravery truly astonished her beyond words.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Sit your ass down, Takeshi,&quot; Edison spoke up, rolling his eyes at the ridiculousness of the scene. &quot;Stop hogging attention for yourself, will you?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;You really can't condemn me for acting on behalf of justice, now can you?&quot; Takeshi's righteous statement earned him a few claps from the audience.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Ruby sneered from the row below. &quot;Gosh, Takeshi. Get a life. No one wants the drama.&quot; Her eyes swept over Gillian in a rude manner. &quot;What do you think you're doing with someone like her? You want to drop down from the social ladder or something?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Oh god. I suppose I should scream and beg for you to save me then?&quot; Takeshi asked, his voice clearly controlled by his use of sarcasm. &quot;Whatever, Ruby. A queen you ain't, so quit bossing like one.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Blue veins protruded from her neck. &quot;How dare you, Takeshi!&quot; By now, raging flames lit up her eyes as she shot abruptly from her seat, surprising the people who were sitting next to her. &quot;You're really nothing without me! Fine, if you think you're so great, then from this instant, you're no longer part of the Rich and the Fabulous! Get lost, loser! In fact, why don't pull that witch along with you too while you're at it?!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Edison watched with amusement. Funny how an ordinary girl like Gillian could spark up such a fiery scene. Oh well, whatever, her problem, not his.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Oh yea?! I will!&quot; Takeshi boasted with a roll of his eyes, clearly peeved. &quot;Unlike someone, who always says and never does, I actually have the courage to do what I wish! I wonder what that makes her? A super, extreme, pathetic loser of all losers?&quot; He laughed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Ruby seemed too stunned for words but her face was turning so red and puffed up, it almost looked like a big, red balloon. A few centimeters more, and it would pop.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Normally, I think Takeshi's a total dimwit but hey, he finally gets something right this time," Kenny spoke up. His bleary eyes showed that he had been napping. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Kenny! Not you too!&quot; Ruby screamed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;That's enough!&quot; Joa Ma blared angrily as he witnessed the chaos circulating around his classroom. He was beyond disbelieved. &quot;You all, shut up! This is a law class, not a bickering class for goodness' sake!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>No one bothered to listen to him as Ruby and Takeshi continued to bicker ferociously, throwing recycled insults back and forth. The audience was watching with amusement as the girls swooned over Takeshi's dominance and courage while Gillian thought she was going to die under all that screaming and yelling. For a moment, she wished she were deaf instead!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;What do you say, Gillian? Aren't I right for standing up for you?&quot; Takeshi suddenly turned and asked Gillian, hoping she'd agree.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Daniel, who had been watching from the side, suddenly wished he had taken the honor to stand up and speak for his Gillian. What, if Takeshi could do it, he should be able to, too. Although, a bit shy and old-fashioned in nature, Daniel still had his own ego to polish. &quot;Gillian, don't worry, I'll support you too!&quot; He shot up from his seat and clapped his hands courageously. &quot;Don't you all agree? Come on, everyone! Don't be such a chicken. We all know Joe Ma is exactly what she said!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Many stared in shock at Daniel's outburst that seemed to explode from nowhere. They would have never expected the well-behaved, respecful Daniel to ever utter such words. A few moments of silence followed until finally, a booming chorus echoed through the classroom in agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Wait, what?!&quot; Edison suddenly snapped from his idle state of mind, the heat of the scene wringing him like a rag. That doofus! He thought. What on Earth did Daniel think he was doing? The fact that his friend could just ditch his good reputation and embark on a barbarous act only made things worse. It only showed how far he had gone with this love for Gillian, and hello? Wasn't that a bit crazy, for Daniel? Not to mention, he was definitely falling deeper for his sister!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Edison shot up from his seat and marched over to Daniel, grabbing him by the shoulder. &quot;Stay out of it, Dan!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Don't be such a wimp, Edison.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Edison rolled his eyes. &quot;Yeah, and blurting out nonsensical shit makes you a hero?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Hey! I'm standing up for Gillian!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;She's not worth it!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Shut up, Edison. I'm sick of you trying to manipulate me! What is it, you're jealous? Is that it?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;No!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Get away from me!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Or what, you'll ladle me to death?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;SHUT UP!!!!&quot; Out of patience, Joe Ma slammed his ruler against his table, breeding a loud deafening sound that spoke of his anger.&nbsp; It was definitely a miracle that his veins hadn't burst yet. &quot;I don't want my classroom to turn into a hyena's nest! Stop now! Anyone who wishes to defy this order might as well pack up and leave the campus!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Takeshi rolled his eyes but even he had to admit he liked the vindictive pleasure of seeing the professor flustered. &quot;Save the act Joe Ma. Why don't you just shove your bad acting skills...into your mouth or something!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;And you, Takeshi, definitely need to shove your ego up your ass!&quot; Ruby screeched.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Kenny burst out laughing. &quot;Nice one, Rubes.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>More insults flew. The chaotic scene resembled a high school food fight, the flying insults being the foods.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>At that very instant, the headmaster came strolling into the classroom for a visit, whistling an angelic tune. However, upon the chaotic atmosphere, his eyes bulged in utter disbelief and stupendous rage. By now, there were some papers flying around the air. Unfortunately for him, a textbook was flying toward his way and in no time, he had his face smashed like a dead squashed pancake.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Everyone gasped.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The poor man was clutching at his nose, trying his best not to fall over. Disbelief with anger created a darkened expression to loom over his face as speculation raged in him. He looked like a thundering demon in its wake. &quot;Can anyone explain to me what in God's name is going on here?&quot; the headmaster, George, said.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Everyone remained speechless until Joe Ma stepped up and gave an abbreviated version of what happened.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;God! That's the most absurd thing I ever heard in my life!&quot; George cried as outrage beat him senseless. &quot;And you didn't try to stop this, Joe?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Joe Ma was trying to explain. &quot;I did try but--&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;He's the reason this happened!&quot; Takeshi added in unnecessarily. Still, he could not withstand to see Joe Ma skimpering away without a punishment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>George eyes grew serious. His face was swollen from the contact of the book and boy, anyone could tell the extreme displeasure that scrambled his face with more wrinkles.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Gillian decided to speak up. &quot;He is an unfair, biased teacher that should not be teaching in law class. He prejudiced against me and my essay because I don't happen to share his petty opinion.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Is that true, Joe?&quot; George raised an eyebrow and asked, expecting full honesty.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Joe's nose flared with indignity, affronted, but then he smiled. &quot;Of course not. She's clearing making this up--&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>George shrugged him off, seemingly not to believe in his words.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After a long hour of close observation and having heard several accounts, the headmaster finally came to a decision. Everyone fiddled in their seats as they opened their ears to listen to the elder man.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;I am aware that the situation seems more complicated that it actually is,&quot; George began, his face fixed with a solemn seriousness. &quot;However, I am sure that all of you here share a responsibility for your unacceptable behavoir. So to be fair, I have decided to punish all of you as a warning to others.&quot; There was a complaint that came from Ruby, and a curse from Takeshi, but other than that, everyone was pretty much silent, waiting for the man to continue. &quot;You all,&quot; he pointed to everyone but Joe, &quot;will do some major cleaning-up at the canteen for three solid weeks. Professor Ma, you will be suspended from work for two weeks. I believe that it is quite a plentiful amount of time for you to sit back and reflect on your teaching career.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;What? How come he only has two weeks of punishment, but we have three??&quot; Takeshi complained.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>George remained calm. &quot;Professor Ma, as I believe, did try to stop this horrendous scene but as for you all, you either instigated further or didn't even bother to stop. You're all lucky that I haven't decided to expel you from school because I know how much your family will be disappointed.&quot; This, he stared hard at Gillian. &quot;Fair or not, you decide.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>That day, everyone left the headmaster's office with a big cloud all over their heads.</div>
