<div><b>Chapter 10 - </b></div>
<div><b>Two Against Two</b></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>***</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Rumors circulated around campus dangerously like fire. Almost everyone had heard about the the Gillian and Daniel ordeal, and how she picked him over Edison. Many girls back-talked Gillian as they churned in envy. Who wouldn't want two of the most gorgeous guys at campus to go completely crazy over you? Unfortunately for Gillian, this envyness quickly morphed into hate and jealousy. The impetuous glares didn't go unnoticed by her careful, detecting skills.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>News had it that Edison was having an extremely hard time getting over it. His face had been drained of color; in its place was a bundle of unfathomable gloomness that scared off anyone who stepped a toe near his presence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It was far from the truth, however. Edison was not unhappy about the fact that Gillian didn't pick him. In fact, he should be as glad as an escaped rabbit from its prey. The truth was, he was beyond infuriated that Daniel was involved. Although he may appear heartless to women, Edison was the type of person that truly cared for his pals. Knowing that Gilian was an evil witch, he couldn't just stand by and watch as his best buddy weaved his own doom.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>One day after class, he saw Gillian by her locker. With eyes that were narrowing into slits, he marched over and approached her in a rather striking manner. &quot;So, heading off to see Daniel, aren't you?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The condemnation in his tone was something Gillian did not appreciate. &quot;How many times do I have to say that it's not any of your business? Why don't you get a life and stop intruding into mines?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;What do you mean it's not any of my business? Daniel is my friend!&quot; Edison rebuked with fiestiness. &quot;And please keep in mind that if I had a choice, I would stay&nbsp;away from you as far as the distance from mars and jupiter if&nbsp;I fucking have to!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The scene was too familiar by now. It had become a weird habit of his to approach her daily with the same nonsense. Gillian had grown immensely sickened by it. &quot;Well, what do you want me to do?!&quot; She screamed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Get away from Daniel.&quot; His simple declaration made her gape in stupendous incredulity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Gillian's mouth twitched to say something but her effort ceased when Daniel inconveniently stepped into the picture. &quot;Bug off, Edison! Don't annoy my girlfriend!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Girlfriend!?! The mere title made Edison's eyes bulge outrageously. &quot;Oh, no, she's not!&quot; He quickly rebutted on impulse. &quot;She's mines!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Impatience scuttled on Daniel's face as he rolled his eyes. &quot;Give it up, Ed. Gillian chose me. Accept your fate.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Never!&quot; Edison hissed with surprising determination. As his eyes glided over to the other end of the hallway, he saw Takeshi and Kenny approaching, drenched in sweat as a basketball bounced on the floor. They must had just returned from basketball practice. An idea instantly wedged its way into his mind. &quot;I have an idea.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Daniel gawked, having a feeling that he wasn't going to like what he was going to hear. But he urged Edison to go on anyway.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;The reason Gillian picked you because she was mad at me! Not because she loves you!&quot; Gillian stared in disbelief at his ridiculous make-up story from the side but in another whole point of view, she actually wanted to know what Edison would do. &quot;I, Edison Chen, challenge you, my friend, to a basketball duel! Whoever scores the highest will of course take the honor to make this lady here his girlfriend!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The idea itself disgusted Edison, for such notion was completely unwanted. However, in order to make Daniel dump those unappropriate thoughts about Gillian once and for all, he must resort to a challenge. He just couldn't think of anything else.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;What? That's ridiculous!&quot; Daniel protested while disbelief stationed in his eyes. &quot;Gillian is not to be passed around like an item!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Well, how else can we settle this when she's unsure of who she loves more?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There was an urge to interrupt their little conversation but Gillian quickly stopped herself. Edison was right. Maybe by doing this, she could get herself out of troubles, that was to keep Daniel away from her. She had to admit that she was an idiot all this time to have left this matter unsolved. She didn't intend it so now she had to somehow fix it. This seemed like an opportunity, even if it came from the asshole Edison Chen.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Actually, let's bring the game on,&quot; Gillian said seriously. Ok, that made her sound like an attention whore, but she had no other choice. &quot;Come on, Dan. Show Ed what you got. I know you'll win this match for sure.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;What is this I hear?&quot; Takeshi finally approached with a befuddled face.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Sounds like a challenge,&quot; said Kenny, a twitch on his lips. &quot;Interesting.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Daniel was still reluctant. However, upon Gillian's encouragement, his confidence boosted up to several levels. He slapped on a grin, confident of his own ability to win Gillian. &quot;It's a deal, Edison.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Oh great! Can I play, too? Can I?!&quot; Takeshi said with enthusiastic eyes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Sure,&quot; said Edison, his eyes fixed. &quot;I do need a good man on my team.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In the end, it was decided that Takeshi and Edison were a team while Daniel and Gillian were another. Kenny opted to be the judge instead.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The four players stationed themselves in the court, all of them bearing a seriously stern face as though they were going to march off into a life-and-death battle. Kenny had the urge to laugh out loud at the ridiculousness of the scene but restrained himself. &quot;Okay, whichever team scores higher than the other in thirty minutes will win. So should we shoot for turns?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Hell yea,&quot; Edison said.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Kenny passed the ball to Gillian. &quot;Ladies, first.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Gillian had never been that athletic herself. She knew she was digging for her own humilation when she agreed to this; nonetheless, she had to do what she had to do. Mustering her strength, she shot for the hoop.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And missed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Takeshi made a sad face. &quot;Aw! That's okay, Gillian!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Edison elbowed him while rolling his eyes at the man's stupidity. &quot;I'm the one on your team, idiot.&quot; He stepped up with the ball and eyed the hoop with an intensity so deep it almost looked like he was a lunatic scientist analyzing a microscopic bacteria. Then in a swift, slow motion, he aimed for the hoop.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And made it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;That's okay, Gillian. We can let the losers go first,&quot; Daniel said supportingly from the side.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Gillian just nodded. Truth was, it did not bother her an eensy bit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A smirk locked itself on Edison's face as the thought of victory simmered in his mind. Oh, this was too easy, he thought. In no time, he would rescue his pal from the evil claws of a witch! He might as well award himself with a big, fat mega pat for that heroic accomplishment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As Kenny blew the whistle as a signal to start, Edison began dribbling the basketball, back and fro through his legs like a pro, the smirk never leaving his face. Gosh, too, too easy!! He thought and chuckled unconsciously in his mind.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Hurry up, man! Do you even know how to dribble?&quot; Takeshi's voice zapped Edison like a lightning.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Oops. Looks like he was too caught up in his own world to realize everyone was staring at him as though he was the number one idiot. Without a moment's delay, Edison mustered his strength and dashed across the court, jumping directly into the act of shooting for the hoop again.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Bad move, however.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Just when he thought he made it, a quick shadow loomed across and snatched the ball mid-air in an all too swift action. Edison had to widen his eyes in complete astound &quot;Wh-wh-what?!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Daniel smirked. &quot;Brush up your skills, pal. This victory is mines.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Maybe in your next lifetime!&quot; Edison hissed stubbornly and called his idle teammate. &quot;Come on! Move your damn legs!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Roger!&quot; Takeshi saluted lamely and dashed toward Daniel with an agility of a trained athletic. He stepped in front of Daniel and blocked off his air supply.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Slightly irritated, Daniel decided to toss the ball to Gillian.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Much to her surprise, Gillian was able to trap the moving object within her embrace. In a quick motion, she flew across the court as Edison trailed after her like an unstoppable force. Each step she took, he would counter impeccably to a point she grew annoyed. He just wouldn't let her off, would he?!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Give it up,&quot; Edison taunted. &quot;Short girl like you can hardly dribble the ball right, let alone shoot it.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;You've underestimated the power of short people,&quot; Gillian said brightly as she took a step back in preparation to launch forward. Her small frame allowed her to easily trudge past her opponents in a swift, fast motion that threw Edison and Takeshi in horrific shock.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Go, Gillian! I know you can do it!&quot; She heard Daniel's voice booming behind. Confidence fired inside her like it never did before as she hopped to shoot for the hoop. She didn't care if she made a mistake. All she wanted to do was show that Edison Chen she was capable of playing a game of basketball.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It went all too fast. In only a short period of time, Gillian had proved herself she had the capability to be a sport player.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Score for team Daniel and Gillian,&quot; Kenny announced.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Whoo!&quot; Daniel cheered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Rage lit inside Edison. Okay, so maybe he had underestimated her power, and overestimated his own, but that didn't mean he was going to lose to that witch! The sparks of determination sprouted inside him. Edison would never lose a challenge. He just couldn't.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Come on!&quot; He screamed ferociously at Takeshi. &quot;Where are all your skills, man? You're so mighty in front of others, but when it comes to this, you're slow like a damn turtoise!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Takeshi's eyes widened at the directed insult, his ego hurt. &quot;Oh, no. The great Takeshi would never let anyone stomp on him like that. You made a grave mistake of approaching that kind of tactic!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Oh, quit yapping, and start moving!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Yapping? Why don't you stop whining like a bitch?&quot; Takeshi shot angrily.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Come on, come on, don't fight. You guys are teammates, remember?&quot; Kenny reminded from the side.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The fire of feud died down as the game resumed. Aggressive as ever, Edison hogged the ball and made a shot.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Score for team Edison and Takeshi,&quot; Kenny announced.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Takeshi seemed displeased, however. &quot;Come on, dude! Stop hogging the damn ball. I'm your teammate too, case you haven't noticed.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Edison was too far from patience to tolerate Takeshi's complaint. His rolled his eyes in irritation. &quot;Question your own ability, then, man.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;What the hell does that supposed to mean?&quot; Takeshi blurted. &quot;You think you're so great, huh?&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Well yes, that is because I am,&quot; Edison boasted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Spirit splintered as the two teammates engaged in a battle of words, each throwing an insult at the other like it was no end.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Stop!&quot; Kenny commanded with an effective supremacy. &quot;At this rate, we would never have a winner.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The two settled down, pushing their current flow of resentment aside. Everyone stationed themselves in position again.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Kenny blew the whistle.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So this was it. The winner of the game shall be uncovered in the last match. Gillian fiddled in unease. If she and Daniel won, that would meant... she was stuck with him for sure. How she was going to untangle herself, she wasn't sure. In another aspect, pride made her dread to lose, for that mean she would have to live up to Edison's teasings. Such idea was completely absurd to her, but was that not a chance to save herself from a throbbing headache and the horrendous mistake?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The ball was tossed around in the air back and forth, unpossessed. There were a few interceptions here and there but everyone's guards were so high up, it was impossible for anyone to score easily. Sweat trickled down their faces as a feeling of determination ran through their blood.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Edison tried to usurp the ball in the air but Takeshi flew in and knocked it out of his hold.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;What the fuck is your problem, man?!&quot; Edison yelled angrily.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Takeshi laughed. &quot;Proves I'm more competent than you, my friend.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;We're a TEAM! You're not supposed to steal my fucking ball!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Oh, well, just admit you suck!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Moron! You're one hell of an immature hooligan!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Takes one to know one, you know!&quot; Takeshi shot back.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>While the two argued feverishly, Daniel usurped the golden oppurtunity to whack the ball out of Takeshi's firm hold. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;What the fuck?&quot; Edison stared in shock at the ball.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Takeshi's eyes protested in rage. &quot;That wasn't fair, Dan!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The ball whirled in the air and surprisingly landed into Gillian's possession. Uncertainty filled her eyes as Gillian contemplated her choices. Oh, god, should she shoot? Maybe she'll make it, and maybe she won't. Who could have ever guessed that a loss or a win at a basketball match would decide and control her fate? Either way, Gillian dreaded both outcomes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here goes nothing, she thought.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>With a strength she didn't know she possessed, Gillian shot the ball into the air as it launched forward like an exploding comet.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Everyone watched impatiently as it floated around the ring, as though stubborn not to fall. Round and round, it circulated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Oh, come on! Drop already!&quot; Edison shouted, anxiety battering his brain. He didn't want the ball to make it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And thud. It bounced on the floor after its victorious fall through the loop. Silence conquered the court until Daniel burst out in joy. Out of sheer happiness, he pulled Gillian into a hug.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;You are awesome,&quot; he whispered gently, proud of her.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Oh, God. This definitely did not look too good.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Congrats, Gillian Chung, you are the world's stupidest idiot, she thought.</div>
