<p class="tocn"></p><h4><!--Subtitle begin-->Finale: It's Date and Dote Now.<!--Subtitle end--></h4>
<!--Chapter begin-->
"Ariel, what the hell are so you troubled about?" Rainie probed as she 
watched her friend gaze blankly at the sky. The three girls were sitting
 at the usual spot under the oak tree in front of heavily decorated 
school. It was Valentines' Day, and everybody on campus looked equally 
high in spirits. "If anyone should be troubled, it's me! I'm the one 
who's going to make a fool out of myself today by singing nursery rhymes
 in front of the school!"<p> </p><p>Ariel sighed. "I don't know. I don't feel too good."</p><p> </p><p>"And why the hell not?" Rainie asked. "You and Joe got back together. What's there to worry?"</p><p> </p><p>"Is it about Selina again?" Gillian quipped. "Did you guys tell her yet?</p><p> </p><p>The
 mention of Selina brought Ariel another headache. Joe had said he was 
going to make the matter clear to her, but still why did Ariel feel so 
uncomfortable inside? When she let him go this morning, Ariel felt as if
 he would never come back to her side again.</p><p> </p><p>"Joe said he's going to tell her today."</p><p> </p><p>"You should be glad then! That witch is finally going down!" Rainie crackled evilly.</p><p> </p><p>"I don't know..." Ariel said, unsurely. "I just have a weird feeling. I trust him. But..."</p><p> </p><p>"But what?" Gillian asked. "Didn't he say the one he likes was you? What's there to worry about?"</p><p> </p><p>"It's
 not that. I'm worried about Selina. I mean, how would she take it? She 
must have liked him for a long time already. It just feels so wrong, as 
if I'm stealing Joe away from her."</p><p> </p><p>"Please, all is fair in love and war, child," Rainie said. "That witch just would have to suck it up."</p><p> </p><p>"I don't know... And would you please stop calling her a witch."</p><p> </p><p>"Hey
 look! That's them isn't it?" Gillian pointed to towards the school's 
gate and indeed, there was Joe walking alongside with Selina.</p><p> </p><p>Watching
 them still had the effect of putting her stomach in churning motions. 
Joe had said that he didn't like Selina that way, but if he had 
misunderstood his feelings for Ariel, how could it not be possible that 
he might misunderstand his feelings for Selina?</p><p> </p><p>She knew she shouldn't be thinking too much, but still...</p><p> </p><p>"Why am I not surprised that you girls are spying?"</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly,
 Mike appeared out of nowhere. Instantly, all three of them shot up from
 their seats, in guarded and cautious positions.</p><p> </p><p>"Mike 
He!" Rainie said with alert, propping her fists at him as though ready 
to take him on. "What do you want this time? I swear if you try anything
 funny I will burst your head open!"</p><p> </p><p>Mike smirked, not at 
all intimidated. "By a girl like you? Wait until your next lifetime when
 you're reincarnated into a man, okay?"</p><p> </p><p>"What! Why you!"</p><p> </p><p>"What do you want?" Ariel spat. She still hadn't forgiven him for what he’d done.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah! What do you want? If you plan for a bunch of gang to rape us again I swear I'll--"</p><p> </p><p>"Look,
 that's not going to happen again," Mike cut through, raising his hands 
in defense. His tone made everyone a bit taken aback. "I know I was 
wrong that day. I was only trying to scare you. I'm sorry. I didn't mean
 for things to turn out that bad."</p><p> </p><p>"You think apologies 
work on us, boy? Please! You clearly do not know what trauma you had put
 Ariel through. A simple apology won't heal everything!"</p><p> </p><p>"I know," Mike said, "but listen, I was out of my mind.” He sighed. "It was stupid and low of me."</p><p> </p><p>"Damn right!" Rainie hissed, still not letting her guard down.</p><p> </p><p>"But
 from that, I came to realize something. That entire revenge thing was 
just an excuse. There were just some things that I couldn’t let go of.”</p><p> </p><p>Rainie
 widened her eyes, part from scrutiny, and part from incredulity. "Oh no
 you don't! You're not trying to mend things with her, are you? It's too
 damn late!"</p><p> </p><p>"Shut up!" He glared at Rainie. "I'm not 
talking to you, okay?" But realizing his use of tone, he relented. 
"Sorry. I just want to finish what I'm saying."</p><p> </p><p>“What do you really want?” Ariel eyed him skeptically. Although his eyes no longer held that hard edge, she still doubted him.</p><p> </p><p>"I told Hebe the whole truth, you know about us," Mike confessed. "She slapped me--"</p><p> </p><p>"Hahaha! That is what a low life bastard like you deserves!" Rainie derided.</p><p> </p><p>"--and
 broke up with me. I'm kind of glad actually. I felt that it was unfair 
to her because I really didn't feel for her that way. It was just a 
mistake--"</p><p> </p><p>"That you can't unwind--"</p><p> </p><p>"What is wrong with you?" Mike hissed at Rainie, clearly pissed off. "Can you stop butting in my sentences?"</p><p> </p><p>"What? I have a freedom to express--"</p><p> </p><p>"So
 do I!" Mike yelled, rendering Rainie speechless. Then he turned to 
Ariel, giving her his full attention. Ariel had never seen him so 
serious. "That day when you almost fell--it gave me a scare. I'm sorry. 
Really. I'm just here to express my deepest apology. I deserve every 
single lashing from you, Ariel, for betraying you, using you, making it 
hard for you. Hebe breaking up with me is my well-deserved dessert. I 
realize that I've done so many shit to you that you don't deserve. The 
guilt gnaws inside me, you know?"</p><p> </p><p>"I don't really hope for
 your forgiveness, because even I wouldn't want to forgive a bastard 
like me. I just want to let you know that I'm remorseful. Even if I 
don't deserve your forgiveness, I owe you this apology. Sorry, Ariel."</p><p> </p><p>Mike
 had never sounded so sincere. Nobody was able to contain their 
disbelief. Was this really the Mike that they knew? It was as if a 
totally different person was standing before them. How could this be the
 Mike that had once hurt Ariel? She remembered those painful three 
months when she nursed her broken heart, the stinging hope that they'd 
get back together, and all of their awkward encounters. They had hurt 
her so much to a point that Ariel questioned if the damage could ever 
heal.</p><p> </p><p>Could she forgive him? Joe once told her that she 
was anything but cold. She was really ferocious outside, but inside, she
 wasn't that tough as she appeared to be.</p><p> </p><p>"Mike," Ariel said, gazing at him with a smile. "Don't worry. You don't have to live with the guilt. I forgive you."</p><p> </p><p>Rainie
 and Gillian widened their eyes in disbelief. It surprised them how 
Ariel was willing to be compassionate, but then it shouldn’t. Ariel 
wasn't the type who'd hold you up for anything.</p><p> </p><p>"Are you sure?" Mike asked, uncertainly. "I mean, it would be hard, but you don't have to--"</p><p> </p><p>"Come
 on!" Ariel said. "What do you take me as? I'm not some petty person, 
okay? Besides, you clearly did try to save me that day."</p><p> </p><p>"But..."</p><p> </p><p>"My generosity doesn't last very long you know. You better take it before I change my mind."</p><p> </p><p>Mike
 looked at her smiling face, feeling a weight dismounting off his 
shoulders. "Ariel, I totally didn't deserve you. You deserve so much 
better. But I believe that your choice this time is right. I wish you 
and Joe happiness."</p><p> </p><p>"Okay, okay, stop the flattery, you 
sycophant," Rainie hissed, getting irritated at Mike's long windedness. 
"Speaking of Joe, did he finish telling that witch yet?!"</p><p> </p><p>"Witch? What witch?" Mike asked, confused.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel's
 eyes immediately went to search for Joe and Selina. But they were gone 
from their previous stance. "Where did they go?" She asked, frantically 
looking around.</p><p> </p><p>"They're gone!" Rainie gasped before turning to Mike. "It's all your fault! You talk so god damn much!"</p><p> </p><p>"They're over there in the corner," Gillian pointed out.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone
 turned their gazes to where Gillian was pointing at, and indeed, there 
they were, in the far corner near the entrance door. Joe was so tall 
that he completely blocked Selina.</p><p> </p><p>"Burn the witch," Rainie said.</p><p> </p><p>"You know what to do," Gillian added.</p><p> </p><p>Mike couldn't help but add on, "Go get your man!"</p><p> </p><p>"Idiot, Joe is already hers!" Rainie bawled.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 gave a smile to her friends, appreciative of their encouraging 
comments. "I think he's having trouble. I gotta give him a hand huh?"</p><p> </p><p>"Obviously, now get your ass out of here."</p><p> </p><p>With
 a nod, Ariel dashed off towards the corner near the school's front 
door. From Joe's body language, he appeared to be in discomfort and 
Ariel was prepared to ease that.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie watched Ariel's 
back, eyes watering. "My God, look at her, she's all grown up." Gillian 
patted Rainie, who was already sobbing. "It feels like it was just 
yesterday when the three of us were all single and drooling over good 
looking guys. Oh, Gillian, what am I going to do without her?"</p><p> </p><p>Mike couldn't help but roll his eyes at Rainie's overdramatic scene.</p><p> </p><p>"Come on, stop crying," Gillian said, digging through Ariel's bag for some tissues.</p><p> </p><p>And that was when a piece of paper slipped.</p><p> </p><p>"Joe?"
 Ariel approached the duo with a tinge of nervousness. She wasn't sure 
how she was going to look at Selina. The girl had been so nice and 
sweet--how could she do this to her?</p><p> </p><p>"Hi Ariel," Selina said with a smile, surprising her.</p><p> </p><p>Even Joe didn't look that tensed anymore. Did something happen? Ariel was baffled.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi Ariel," Selina greeted with a smile. Her friendliness only made Ariel feel even worse. “I see you’re here to get Joe?”</p><p> </p><p>"Selina, I'm sorry-"</p><p> </p><p>"Oh
 no, don't be." Selina's eyes sparked, as though she had expected it. "I
 was never interested in Joe. Do you remember what I once told you? I 
only treat him as a brother. It’s true."</p><p> </p><p>Indeed, Ariel remembered. But even then, Ariel doubted the truth of her words. "But yesterday, didn't you say-”</p><p> </p><p>Selina giggled girlishly. Even Joe was smiling. What was going on?</p><p> </p><p>"I'm
 sorry, Ariel, that was all an act. When I heard that you two were item,
 I wasn't really that shocked. I have suspected that you two have some 
sort of relationship. Even if it's a bet, I could clearly see that you 
two had genuine feelings for each other."</p><p> </p><p>"But why did you do that?" Ariel couldn't comprehend her intentions.</p><p> </p><p>Selina
 turned to look at Joe, poking his nose playfully. Such intimacy still 
made Ariel wince. "It's all because of this cold prince here. He was 
denying his feelings right on the spot. Even Rainie railing on him 
didn't do much. So I thought I had to do something. I knew that he 
wasn't going to realize his feelings until he's pushed towards the 
cliff. And that's exactly what I did."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel's remembered 
Selina's fierceness when she demanded that Joe kiss her. At that time, 
she only managed to think that Selina bore Joe hidden feelings. Never 
would she have imagined that it was all an act.</p><p> </p><p>"You were very cruel, Selina. Fancy manipulating me like that," Joe commented.</p><p> </p><p>"If it weren't for me, would you have finally known who you really, really like?" Selina asked, winking.</p><p> </p><p>There was still a matter not yet clear to Ariel. "But... you two clearly did kiss--"</p><p> </p><p>"Oh,
 you silly girl. He turned his face away before I even touch his lips. 
You left before you even saw what exactly happened. That's when Joe 
finally realizes that he doesn't love me. All along, he has always loved
 you, Ariel." Selina said with a giggle. "Don't you think I didn't see 
that kiss that night at the party. Joe, I never knew you had it in you!"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel's
 eyes met Joe, but he immediately darted them everywhere, obviously 
embarrassed. "Can you stop the rubbish?" Inside, Ariel was undeniably 
soaring with a sudden burst of happiness.</p><p> </p><p>"Fine, fine, I 
won't tease you anymore, party pooper. See, my boyfriend's coming for 
me." Selina waved her hands with enthusiasm. "Sorry Joe that I haven't 
told you. But we've been going out for a few months now. But since you 
never told me you were with Ariel before, then I guess it's even, haha."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 turned around and saw a tall, handsome man approaching them. He had 
golden spiky hair that glowed under the sun and a tan that looked 
naturally good. She couldn't help but let the surprise lingered on her 
face. Joe, too, was taken aback.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey Jiro."</p><p> </p><p>"Selina honey."</p><p> </p><p>She slapped him in the arm. "Wei, I told you not to call me such embarrassing names!"</p><p> </p><p>"Can't help it. You're face is just too sweet," Jiro suavely replied, before turning to Joe and Ariel. "Hey there."</p><p> </p><p>Joe and Ariel exchanged similar glances before bursting into smiles and greeting Selina's boyfriend back.</p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p> </p><p>It
 was finally time for Rainie to carry out her punishment and sing the 
nursery rhymes in front of the school courtyard where numerous students 
hang out during lunch time. Ariel, Joe, Rainie, Gillian, Selina, Jiro, 
Mike, and even Jolin were all present, along with many other classmates,
 in anticipation for Rainie's little show.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie inwardly
 sighed. Everyone was in pairs. Ariel &amp; Joe, Selina &amp; Jiro, even
 the snappy Jolin found herself a match with the senior Jay Chou. It was
 only her that was completely dateless. Well, except for Gillian but 
then, she didn't count. And that Mike who had just broken up with his 
girlfriend, he didn't count either.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel was bursting 
into smiles every second and Rainie looked at her with slightly annoyed 
looks. "Someone take her to the hospital. She's gone mad from love," 
Rainie remarked, crossing her arms.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel stuck her tongue
 at her friend. "I think you should worry about yourself, dear! Boy, I 
just can't wait to hear your voice in a moment! I absolutely don't mind 
more sugar!"</p><p> </p><p>Rainie's expression now morphed into 
mischief. 'Hah! Look at your smiley face right now! Ariel, Ariel, Ariel,
 you just don't know what's coming for you, do you? And look at that 
Joe! He's acting so cool and relaxed. Let's see how cool and relaxed 
you'll be.' Rainie snickered mentally.</p><p> </p><p>Gillian and Mike only looked at Rainie, shaking their heads.</p><p> </p><p>"Wei, Rainie, are you okay?" Ariel asked. "I think you're the one who needs to go to the hospital."</p><p> </p><p>Rainie
 snapped. "Nonsense! Just watch!" Smirking, she ran up the steps and 
stood at the top, holding the loud announcer. In just a moment, she was 
about to execute a show that was to be the best ever! Perhaps, she could
 even record it and send it off to some TV stations! Rainie couldn't 
help but laugh at all the possibilities. Good thing she had a camcorder.</p><p> </p><p>"All
 students of Fei Hu! Gather, gather! Let us have a moment of Valentines'
 Special! I'm sure you guys are all in pairs and everything and boy, is 
this a happy day!"</p><p> </p><p>"What do you think is wrong with her?" Ariel whispered to Joe. "I think she's up to something."</p><p> </p><p>"How should I know? She's your friend, not mine."</p><p> </p><p>"Why
 don't we invite our golden couple who has been going out for THREE 
MONTHS to come out and do a little speech for us?!" Rainie blared 
through the announcer, smiling towards Joe and Ariel who by now embodied
 horror looks. "Come on, Joe &amp; Ariel! Come up here! You know you 
want to!"</p><p> </p><p>"What are you doing?!" Ariel hissed, stomping her feet.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie
 only smiled devilishly. "Classmates, classmates! Do you want our golden
 couple to come up here?" She shot the crowd her threatening alligator 
looks.</p><p> </p><p>"YES!!!!!"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel looked 
flabbergasted. Since when was the school so fond of her going out with 
Joe Cheng, its cold prince? She shot Rainie an outraged look. "We're not
 going up there!" She yelled.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, she felt a grip on her arm. Turning around, it was a robotic looking Gillian. "Gillian--?"</p><p> </p><p>Joe was gripped by Mike.</p><p> </p><p>"Wei, get yours hands off of me-"</p><p> </p><p>"Sorry, no can do. You guys should know what you did."</p><p> </p><p>"Gillian, let me go!"</p><p> </p><p>"Sorry, but we're going to drag you two up there if we had to."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 looked outraged. "What--" but she didn't have a chance to finish her 
thought when she was hauled up the steps and to the top. Since when did 
Gillian become so strong?! Ariel couldn't help but thunder.</p><p> </p><p>Before
 she knew it, she and Joe were both on the patio with an evil looking 
Rainie. Joe glared at Ariel, demanding some answers, but she only 
returned his look with an equally flustered expression. "So, Prince Joe 
and Princess Ariel, can you say a few words to our students--"</p><p> </p><p>"Rainie, what are you doing!" Ariel demanded madly. "You're supposed to be singing the rhymes!"</p><p> </p><p>Rainie
 turned her head around, so she wouldn't speak into the announcer. She 
dug into her pockets and pulled out a piece of paper, much to Ariel’s 
surprise. "Don't you think I don't know about that Date and Dump 
contract between you two. How dare you cheat me!"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel's eyes widened in stupefaction. Even Joe looked completely off guard.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie sneered at them. "You're going to pay for it."</p><p> </p><p>"Wei! You told her about it?!" Joe shot daggers at Ariel.</p><p> </p><p>"I swear! No!" She rebuked.</p><p> </p><p>"You
 guys thought you were so smart huh? Ariel, I can’t believe you’d fool 
me like that! I really thought you had the talent to court Joe, but it 
turns out you made some sort of deal with him! Is this how you take on a
 challenge? You cheated, Ariel! Now, you’re going to pay!” Rainie’s eyes
 contained neither sympathy nor compassion as she stared into the crowd.
 “Students, students! Why don’t we have these two-”</p><p> </p><p>"Rainie, stop it!" Ariel demanded. "What are we supposed to say?!"</p><p> </p><p>Rainie
 shot Ariel teasing eyes. "You should have thought about that before 
coming up with the contract," she smirked naughtily. "Come on, say 
something. You owe me since it turns out you're the loser of the bet."</p><p> </p><p>"What?" Ariel asked, confused.</p><p> </p><p>"Ahem,
 Party A will lose the bet and suffer humiliation in front of the school
 if she breaches the term..." Rainie recited, making Ariel's skin flush.
 "Do you guys need me to remind you that falling in love was one of your
 terms?" Upon that defeated look on Ariel's face, Rainie smirked and 
faced the crowd. "Why don't we ask our golden couple to give each other a
 passionate kiss?"</p><p> </p><p>"Wei!" Ariel protested.</p><p> </p><p>"Ahem, Party B will kiss Party A passionately if he breaches the term--"</p><p> </p><p>Joe looked irritated. He didn't like the attention at all. "Wei, cut the crap. I don't have time for this."</p><p> </p><p>"The
 cold prince is leaving!" Rainie blared into the announcer. "Is this the
 golden couple that we had so long admired? Why is the prince so cold to
 his princess? Could it be that their relationship is nothing but a 
fake?!"</p><p> </p><p>Gasps exploded out of the audience as they gossiped among each other.</p><p> </p><p>Joe stopped in his steps, anger on the brink of explosion.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie
 looked at her friends with a smile. "So, Joe and Ariel, will you two 
please kiss?" She asked, even though it was a devil's command in 
disguise.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel glanced at Joe with discomfort. She knew 
that he didn't like to show his affections publicly. Hell, they never 
even held hands once.</p><p> </p><p>"KISS! KISS! KISS!!!!!" The crowd roared monstrously.</p><p> </p><p>"Joe, what are we going to do?" Ariel whispered.</p><p> </p><p>"How should I know?" He boomed with little patience. "This was all your fault for coming up with that stupid contract!"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel bit her lips in guilt. "Well it's no use moping about it! Why don't you just kiss me?"</p><p> </p><p>"No!" Joe blared back instantly, wounding Ariel. He immediately said afterwards, "Not in public!"</p><p> </p><p>"But why? If you love me, it shouldn't matter all that much--"</p><p> </p><p>"Joe
 and Ariel, what are you guys talking about?" Rainie asked through the 
announcer, making the audience curious. "Look at these two lovebirds! 
They're completely in their own world and ignoring us! We must make them
 kiss, right everyone?"</p><p> </p><p>"RIGHT!!!"</p><p> </p><p>"Stop with the announcer already!" Ariel hissed.</p><p> </p><p>"Forget
 it," Rainie whispered, "You guys can't escape now. I'm going to make 
you pay. Now hurry up and kiss or the audience and ME will go mad."</p><p> </p><p>Joe and Ariel stared at each other for five whole seconds, as though communicating in a telepathic method.</p><p> </p><p>"Are you thinking of what I'm thinking?" Ariel asked.</p><p> </p><p>"Are you looking at where I'm looking?" Joe replied.</p><p> </p><p>Suspicion
 rose in Rainie's expression. But before she could even pinpoint to what
 they were up to, they were already dashing away down the steps in utter
 haste, hand in hand. Rainie was shocked for a moment but she quickly 
recovered as she blared into her announcer. "COME BACK HERE! STOP 
RUNNING! HOW DARE YOU! COME BACK!" She broke into a chase in her super 
high heels.</p><p> </p><p>"ARIEL LIN YI CHEN! JOE CHENG YUAN CHANG! STOP FOR ME RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</p><p> </p><p>And then the loud mouthed princess finally tripped.</p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 and Ariel finally stopped in a desolated place in the far vicinity of 
their school, panting and breathing hard in exhaustion. Ariel wasn't 
sure how long they ran, but it must be at least a mile or so. At least, 
it felt like it.</p><p> </p><p>She watched him. He was having a meek 
smile on his face despite his tiredness and Ariel couldn't help but 
smile along. He enjoyed the run as much as she did, didn't he? Elation 
shot through her like cooling waves.</p><p> </p><p>Joe recovered his 
usual annoyed expression when he realized he was caught. "Look at you. 
You're smiling like just an idiot," he told her.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel's smile was wiped off just like that. "What?"</p><p> </p><p>"You really don't get any smarter do you? Sometimes, I really wonder what material your brain is made of."</p><p> </p><p>Infuriation
 immediately simmered in Ariel's blood at his insult, but then it 
completely dispensed as mischief shadowed her eyes. "Oh, whatever Joe. I
 don't trust whatever comes out of your mouth. You tend to say things 
you don't mean."</p><p> </p><p>Joe looked alarmed. "What is that supposed to mean? I am not a hypocrite-"</p><p> </p><p>"Oh shut up, Joe. I know you by now," Ariel said, smirking. "You can't fool me anymore."</p><p> </p><p>"I
 don't know what you're talking about." Joe was stubborn. "Anyway, 
anything that comes from a bonehead like you bound to not make sense."</p><p> </p><p>Here
 he was at it again, insulting her. There were just some things that 
would never change. "Ahem. Joe, remember, Party B cannot insult Party A.
 Valentines' Day isn't over yet."</p><p> </p><p>Joe gazed at her annoyed expression, unable to stifle a smile. "You know... speaking of that contract--"</p><p> </p><p>"It was stupid, I know." Ariel said. "You don't have to-"</p><p> </p><p>"Actually, I wouldn’t be too sure about that…” he disclosed a bit too vaguely. “It has actually helped me several times.”</p><p> </p><p>Ariel's ears immediately perked up. "Huh? What do you mean?"</p><p> </p><p>"If you're smart, you'll figure it out," Joe smirked.</p><p> </p><p>"Come on, tell me!" Ariel said, but he turned himself around. She followed him, grabbing on his arm. "Tell me, tell me!"</p><p> </p><p>"Why can't you put some effort?" Joe asked, clearly discontented.</p><p> </p><p>"I
 know!" Ariel snapped her fingers. "It gave you excuses to kiss me huh?"
 She giggled, remembering the conversation with Jolin. "If you didn't 
like me, you would have never kissed me."</p><p> </p><p>Joe was 
surprised for a minute, but he was careful not to display it. "Someone 
must have told you that," he muttered, but Ariel's ears were sharp.</p><p> </p><p>"It's
 true?!" Ariel squealed, jumping up and down. "Oh my god! I wasn't too 
sure but now, you even admit it. Awww Joe. You were in love with me!" 
She teased.</p><p> </p><p>"Stop jumping," Joe scolded, feigning 
irritation. Ariel obeyed, but she couldn't stop smiling. "It's not only 
that though..." he trailed off, making Ariel chucked him a questioning 
gaze. “It gives me the obligation to protect you. I was always hesitant 
to do that before, but after the contract, I always did my best to keep 
you safe. It might sound stupid, but I think I was afraid to show too 
much concern for you. You know, I think this thing has made me more 
expressive now."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel's eyes felt like they were 
watering. She didn't think Joe had ever spoken to her with words so full
 of sincerity, care, and passion all in one. Compared to the first time 
they met, this Joe was a thousand times more humane.</p><p> </p><p>“We 
should have given it a better title, because the current one doesn’t 
seem to fit,” he suddenly said with a smug grin. “Like maybe… Date and 
Dote?”</p><p> </p><p>“Stop teasing me.” She blushed, brushing his 
comment off. "Well, I also have some confessions to make..." Ariel 
murmured. "I never told you because I thought you'd laugh at me. But the
 contract was just an excuse to stay by your side. I knew I was falling 
in love with you but I thought that I could stop that with a contract. 
That way, I would be able to stay by your side without any expectations 
and hope. So after signing it, I thought I didn't have any feelings for 
you anymore. But I was so wrong..."</p><p> </p><p>Joe grabbed her hands, squeezing them. "Actually, I kind of figured that out already."</p><p> </p><p>She gazed at him, wide-eyed. "Really?! How?"</p><p> </p><p>"Even a fool can see you're heads over heels with me," Joe smirked.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel tore her gaze away, suddenly shy. "That's because they're genuine..."</p><p> </p><p>"So you're saying my feelings aren't?"</p><p> </p><p>"No, t-that's not what I meant! Well... You're just an inexpressive person. So it's hard to see through you, that's all..."</p><p> </p><p>"Are
 you sure?" His question made her look at him with puzzlement. But Joe 
only smirked before he pulled her into a passionate kiss, surprising 
her.</p><p> </p><p>When they pulled apart, they were breathing hard. 
Forehead against forehead, Ariel couldn't help but widen her smiles. He 
returned her smiles, kissing her cheeks, then her chin and neck, softly 
nibbling her. She giggled, seeing passersby staring at them. "There are 
people here..."</p><p> </p><p>"Who cares..." he murmured, capturing her lips again.</p><p> </p><p>They
 were completely in their own world. To others' eyes, they may resemble 
reckless teenagers, crazy from hormones, but to themselves, they were 
only expressing their honest love to one another on a beautiful 
Valentines' day...</p><p> </p><p>This is not a perfect ending.</p><p> </p><p>But only a perfect beginning.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>FIN.</p><p>(afterwords coming soon)
