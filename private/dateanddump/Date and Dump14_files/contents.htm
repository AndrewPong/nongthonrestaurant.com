<p class="tocn"></p><h4><!--Subtitle begin-->Convo Gone... Wacko?<!--Subtitle end--></h4>
<!--Chapter begin-->
"I can't believe it... Just when I thought I fell in love!" Rainie 
bawled as she grabbed tissues and tissues to blow her running nose. She 
could not help but cry continuously at the painful disappointment.<p> </p><p>Ariel
 continued to feed her friend tissues. Gillian was trying to best to 
soothe the girl's emotions by patting her but everything was to no 
avail. The girl was too heartbroken and could only spill her tears to 
demonstrate her misfortune.</p><p> </p><p>"Rainie, it's not your fault," Ariel tried to assure her. "You didn't know he was that type of guy. Believe me, it's his loss."</p><p> </p><p>"I can't believe I was fooled!" Rainie cried. "He was so nice!"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 pulled her friend into a hug. "All guys are jerks," she spat with 
abhorrence, remembering Mike. "They consider us girls as objects to 
attain, but once they do that, they'll go seek for another girl. They're
 better off dead than wasting space on this planet." Her words filled 
with immense hatred for the opposite sex, something that would be 
considered weird to come out from a girl who currently has a boyfriend, 
but Rainie was far too heartbroken to look into her words.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie
 bawled again, wailing like a little girl. "I thought I'd be fine, but 
it hurts too much! I really did genuinely like him, even though it was 
only two days!"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel nodded, showing her understanding. 
Actually, she was a bit surprised at how Rainie reacted to this 
relationship. Perhaps, it was first love despite not being her first 
relationship. Rainie never seemed like the type to cry over guys like 
this, but maybe love was that powerful...</p><p> </p><p>Ariel should 
know. She had gone through the same thing with Mike for three months. 
Now, it was hard for her to regain that innocent trust in guys. Seeing 
Rainie going through what she had, Ariel was exploding with uptight 
sympathy and sorrow.</p><p> </p><p>"Rainie, don't worry. You'll find a better guy than him," Gillian cajoled.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 tightened her hug on the shivering girl. How could love make one smile 
with priceless bliss yet at the same time cry one's heart out?</p><p> </p><p>The
 next day, Ariel was exhausted. Yesterday, Rainie wanted to stay over at
 her home and both girls talked and accompanied each other throughout 
the night without sleep. Her eyes were now surrounded by black bags and 
she looked horrible as ever.</p><p> </p><p>Thank God the day had already ended. Ariel didn't know how she survived but she was damn glad that she did.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly,
 she bumped into someone. It took her a few seconds or so to realize it,
 but when she did, there wasn't even enough energy to appear surprised.</p><p> </p><p>"You're like a walking zombie," Joe commented, studying her appearance with disgust. "Are you really going to study like this?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel gazed at him, a bit puzzled. "Study?"</p><p> </p><p>"What have you been doing all night? Playing video games perhaps?" Joe derogatorily asked. "You forgot the exam's tomorrow?"</p><p> </p><p>He
 was getting impatient but Ariel finally remembered. The day they'd been
 preparing and studying for was finally coming. Ariel had told Joe that 
she was going to pass with high scores this time and she even boasted 
and told him she was going to treat him to an extravanous dinner but 
now, how in the world will she prep for the exam like this?</p><p> </p><p>An
 exhausted sigh flew out of Ariel's mouth as her eyes shot down with 
little spirits. "So tired. I want to go home and sleep," she said, 
brushing pass him.</p><p> </p><p>But Joe would not allow that. He 
grabbed the back of her shirt and pulled her back as though she was a 
limbless puppet. "Wei, are you planning to fail or something? How will I
 face Mr. Wang?"</p><p> </p><p>"Sleep. I want sleep," Ariel murmured as though she was in a daze.</p><p> </p><p>"Where
 did your ambition fly off to? Your determination is that thin?" Joe let
 out an irritated sigh. But as his will have it, he would not relent 
that easily. With a strong and ungentle force, he dragged the half 
conscious zombie across the school's courtyard and out of the door with 
weird gawks and jealous stares from other students</p><p> </p><p>When 
Joe successfully dragged Ariel to her home, he rang the door bell. 
Ariel's mother, Rilla, was surprised to see a handsome young man at her 
door.</p><p> </p><p>"Hi Rilla," Ariel greeted her mom still in a daze and looking exhausted.</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 was slightly taken aback by how Ariel referred to her mom with her 
first name. That was some lack of manners, he thought, but in another 
aspect, he sort of envied the obvious intimacy. "Hi Aunty."</p><p> </p><p>Rilla's eyes sparked. "Hi there, Joe."</p><p> </p><p>The
 two stepped into their house with Ariel stumbling across the threshold.
 "I don't understand why you'd want to come here," she muttered. "Well 
help yourself, I'm going to sleep."</p><p> </p><p>Joe hissed a "Wei" 
when she strutted off the stairs, attempting to make a grab for her 
shirt again but not being so fast this time, he inevitably missed. When 
he caught Rilla's stare, he flushed with embarrassment.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you helping Ariel study?” Rilla asked, smiling.</p><p> </p><p>Joe nodded uncomfortably. The lady’s eyes were all over him.</p><p> </p><p>"Joe!"
 Suddenly, Grandfather Lin appeared out of nowhere. "What a pleasant 
surprise you're here! My god, why didn't you notify us?"</p><p> </p><p>"Hi Grandpa," Joe said politely. "I'm going to go upstairs, if you don't mind."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh no, of course I won't. Just don't be too crazy okay?"</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 blinked with confusion, but he didn't make a further comment before 
ascending to Ariel's room. Much to his irritation, the ugly sight of 
Ariel slouching halfway on her bed greeted him. Apparently, she didn't 
seem to mind her image.</p><p> </p><p>"Wei, get up," Joe tugged on her arm.</p><p> </p><p>"Leave me alone," she muttered.</p><p> </p><p>"You
 disappoint me, airhead. I thought you were more than that. But now, it 
seems that I was wrong. You're just a sloth who obviously has no goal in
 life."</p><p> </p><p>That moment, Ariel's eyes snapped right open like a
 revived corpse. His denigrating tone was the main catalyst to her 
sudden awareness. "Wei, what did you say?!" She hissed, pointing a 
finger at him with a challenging tone.</p><p> </p><p>"What? Becoming 
deaf again? You have a weird habit of turning deaf to the things you 
hate to hear, don't you?" Joe said tauntingly.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm not a sloth!" Ariel bellowed, tempted to be angry.</p><p> </p><p>"You're discarding your studying aren't you?"</p><p> </p><p>"Hahaha,
 mister, who do you think you are to dictate what I'm doing!" Ariel 
immediately got up and scurried over to her desk. "See, I'm studying," 
she said, pulling out books.</p><p> </p><p>Joe smirked. He looked around for an extra chair but there was none. "Wei, is there a chair somewhere for me to sit?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel grinned, remembering the exact scenario from before. "What? You can always sit on my bed."</p><p> </p><p>"Who wants to sit on your dirty bed?" He instantly retorted.</p><p> </p><p>"There's always the floor." She said, in a mocking tone.</p><p> </p><p>For
 the next twenty minutes, Ariel ignored his presence. Despite having her
 eyes glued to the textbook, her mind was anywhere but there. She was 
actually sleeping, with her eyes open if that was possible. Even if it 
wasn't, she was at least half unconscious. Her immobility seemed to 
raise suspicions, unfortunately, and Joe found himself towering over her
 with the discovery that she was still on the same page as twenty 
minutes ago.</p><p> </p><p>Joe's patience evaporated instantly. "Ariel Lin Yi Chen!!</p><p> </p><p>Ariel snapped back immediately. It wasn't a everyday thing that he called her by her name, let alone, her full name.</p><p> </p><p>"Is
 this how you do things?!" Joe blared, no longer controlling his anger. 
"I took my time to make sure you study and this is how you perform? How 
do you answer to me, huh?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel blinked, never seeing him
 so serious and maddened before. It suddenly made her wonder why he 
chipped in so much effort when it was her grades, not his. And since 
when did he care so much about her?</p><p> </p><p>"Forget it. For a lazy
 pig like you, it'll take a miracle for you to read even a page!" He 
slammed the textbook shut, frightening Ariel. No longer could she detect
 the Joe that once tried to protect her. "I'm going home now. Good-bye."</p><p> </p><p>"Wait,"
 Ariel beckoned, feeling slightly guilty. "You're... you're not going to
 help me study?" Somehow the idea of him leaving didn't sound too 
pleasant.</p><p> </p><p>"That's just wasting my time," Joe spat.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel turned a bit red. "What's that supposed to mean?"</p><p> </p><p>"It means you're an incorrigible pig," he rebuked, ready to jerk open the door.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 shot up from her seat and approached him, expression a rambling mess of
 exasperation. Was it her fault that she was this tired? She couldn't 
help it! Why couldn't he bear her some thought and consideration? If 
only he knew how hard it was to function twenty four hours without a 
second of sleep! "You're not allowed to insult me!" Ariel heaved.</p><p> </p><p>"I'd spit some more insults if I had to!" Joe responded.</p><p> </p><p>"You!" Her breath became shallow as she glared daggers at him, feeling her blood pressure shooting up. "Fine! Go! Leave!"</p><p> </p><p>"Gladly."</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 threw the door open, not bothering to hide his emotions. He was, 
however, a bit taken aback to find Grandfather Lin and Rilla standing 
right before him with baffled and questioning expressions.</p><p> </p><p>"You're leaving already?" Grandfather Lin asked with a tinge of dread in his tone. "But you just got here! Stay longer, son!"</p><p> </p><p>"Grandpa! Don't stop him if he wants to go!" Ariel shouted from inside.</p><p> </p><p>"You
 can't leave so soon. Who is going to help our Ariel study for the exam 
tomorrow?" Rilla asked with an exaggerated expression. She had heard 
their argument just right outside the door moments ago. Knowing that 
Ariel won't study if he left, Rilla was determined to not let Joe leave.
 But of course, she too wanted them to make-up. Rilla had a sharp eye 
for men and from the moment she saw Joe, she knew he was the perfect 
candidate for her sassy daughter even though she knew this relationship 
was bogus. "Come on, stay. I even make some snacks."</p><p> </p><p>"Sorry
 Aunty, but I really have to go." Joe attempted to pass the two adults, 
but like siamese twins, they stuck together, disinclined to let him 
through.</p><p> </p><p>"You leaving right now means you bear this old 
man no face," Grandfather Lin said with a grumbling tone. "Young man, 
have you no respect?"</p><p> </p><p>"Grandpa! Rilla!" Ariel shrieked, 
appearing at the door. "I don't want him here!" When she met Joe's gaze,
 her infuriation only escalated by a thousand levels. Go!" She pushed 
Joe and he slammed into the two adults.</p><p> </p><p>"Wei!" Joe hissed.</p><p> </p><p>"Leave!" Ariel yelled.</p><p> </p><p>Grandfather
 Lin and Rilla exchanged glances, pushing Joe back into the room with as
 much force. "You can't leave!" Both adults stubbornly exclaimed. The 
poor boy was sandwiched between the Lins. It was only in due time 'til 
he turn into a piece of flattened pancake.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, Joe 
had enough. The incessant shoving was not only a damage to his physical 
well being but also to his dying tolerance. "STOP!"</p><p> </p><p>As though he had just pressed a button, the three stopped.</p><p> </p><p>"I'll stay."</p><p> </p><p>Grandfather
 Lin and Rilla jumped up and down, giving each other high fives while 
Ariel looked like she wanted to choke Joe. "That's great!" Grandfather 
Lin exclaimed, shoving Joe back into the room. He smashed into Ariel, 
who was stubborn as ever to stay rooted to the floor, now allowing him 
to enter her room.</p><p> </p><p>"Ariel! Get out of the way!" Rilla 
chided, shoving her daughter to the side. She stumbled a bit and the two
 adults escorted Joe into the room as though he was a king.</p><p> </p><p>"Have
 fun studying okay? Here are some cookies and refreshments if you're 
hungry," Rilla offered a bright gleaming smile before she pulled the 
grinning grandpa out of the room.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel crossed her arms, 
not believing her family's childishness and insistence. She didn't 
understand why practically every adult wanted to matchmake her to Joe. 
Why was her fate ever intertwined with him? Ever since she met him, 
disaster continuously came knocking at her door.</p><p> </p><p>"Why did you choose to stay," Ariel asked flatly, still bearing that angry expression.</p><p> </p><p>"Pointless question. Would I have the life to leave if I didn't abide your family's request?"</p><p> </p><p>Silence
 permeated the air as the two fell into a stale awkwardness. Ariel did 
not know what to say, but she as hell didn't want to talk to him until 
he apologized for his crude insults. But then, she didn't expect the 
silence to be SO awkward.</p><p> </p><p>"Why don't you continue studying," Joe suggested.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 gazed at him, almost in disbelief. He was acting as if nothing had 
happened and that she could not accept. "What the hell is wrong with 
you? Don't you even have a least bit of decency to say sorry to me?"</p><p> </p><p>"What mistake did I make? Why do I have to apologize?" He asked obstinately.</p><p> </p><p>"You
 called me names!" She pointed out loudly and righteously. "If you 
happened to have forgotten, Mr. Cheng, you clearly agreed to never call 
me names. I have proof right here." Ariel dug through her drawers and 
pulled out the contract, pointing at term #3 proudly and arrogantly. "If
 you don't apologize right now, you'd have to kiss me."</p><p> </p><p>Irritancy
 swallowed his face whole as he glared at her. It took him several 
seconds, almost a minute even, to finally utter a "Sorry."</p><p> </p><p>Although
 it didn't sound sincere enough, Ariel knew she shouldn't push it since 
she was the one who fell asleep. Not wanting to pursue the matter 
anymore, she sat at her desk and resumed her studies, already full awake
 by the earlier commotion. The room was quiet, almost deafening, and 
after another twenty minutes, Ariel was getting bored.</p><p> </p><p>"Do you want to eat?" Ariel asked, gobbling on a cookie.</p><p> </p><p>Joe shook his head. "I don't like sweets."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh."</p><p> </p><p>He
 appeared bored, and Ariel bit her lips, guilt rambling inside her. 
"Look, if you're bored, you can go now. I don't think they will stop you
 again this time." She said, not looking at him.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm not bored."</p><p> </p><p>"You're a poor liar. Your face says it all."</p><p> </p><p>"Haven’t I always appeared like this?” He asked softly, in deep thought.</p><p> </p><p>“Hmmm.
 You’re right--” Ariel stopped short when she gazed at him. That was 
when she caught him in his contemplating expression, something she had 
never seen before. For a moment, he appeared so withdrawn, almost 
mysterious.</p><p> </p><p>"Was your family always this lively?"</p><p> </p><p>Huh?
 Where did that come from? Ariel couldn't help but wonder. "Well, 
they're a tad bit crazy, but they're still normal people. Don't think 
they're like clowns or something okay."</p><p> </p><p>"I envy you. Your family seems to care so much about you."</p><p> </p><p>She
 was beginning to see some bits of his thoughts. "So does your mom," she
 pointed out, remembering how friendly and welcoming Mrs. Cheng was.</p><p> </p><p>"Really," he said bitterly. "You call ignoring my feelings caring about me?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel was a bit confused. "What do you mean?"</p><p> </p><p>"Ten
 years ago, my parents divorced. I wanted to go with dad, but I ended up
 with my mom. She never asked me who I wanted to go with, only assumed 
that I needed her, since I was quite young. I was disappointed that dad 
let me go. He said that it was the best for me, but if there is anyone 
who understood a bit of me, it would be him. At least, he asks me 
questions. Unlike my mom, who always assumes. Sure, she provides me a 
lot, money, clothes, attention, but really, she doesn't even care about 
my feelings at all. For some weird reason, I never looked up to her as a
 child should."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel gazed at him; quite taken aback that
 he viewed his mother in such imperfection. From her encounter with Mrs.
 Cheng, the lady appeared to be benevolent, almost like a perfect 
mother. But then, she remembered that night in the forest at the temple,
 when he once told her that his mother disregarded his feelings and sent
 him to a new school without his liking. "Why don't you ever talk to her
 about your problems? From what I see, you lack communication. How is 
she supposed to know what you're thinking?"</p><p> </p><p>"Shouldn't a mom know what her child wants? And besides, does she ever ask?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 crawled to the floor and sat next to him against the wall. "Mrs. Cheng 
probably thought she does know you, so that's why she never asks. The 
bottom line is, her perception is wrong, and you didn't correct that. 
You should talk to her. Mothers aren't telepathists."</p><p> </p><p>"She should have at least tried to be."</p><p> </p><p>"Why didn't you tell her that you wanted to go with your dad?" Ariel asked.</p><p> </p><p>"I'd
 be a burden to him," Joe answered softly. "He was bankrupted at that 
time, so I would have no chance of staying with him anyway. But still, 
I've always wondered how I would turn out if I stayed with him instead."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 could see Joe bore a deep admiration for his father, something she 
found very touching. It was ironic how he loved someone who was far away
 more than the person who stood next to him all of those years, but then
 she could see his stance. Although Mrs. Cheng was a nice woman, she 
lacked that charm to draw her close ones towards her. Maybe it was 
because as Joe said, she never genuinely cared enough to ask. When a 
person is disappointed at his mother at a young age, that feeling is 
sure to shadow the years of his growth, and somehow Ariel could 
understand that.</p><p> </p><p>"You like your father a lot, don't you?"</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 gazed at her, sort of smiling in the eyes. "Of course. He is the best. 
He taught me a lot of things when I was little. Do you know that my 
first time playing basketball was with him? I was a short kid back then.
 Who knows, maybe that helped me achieve my height today." He chuckled, 
making Ariel a bit surprised.</p><p> </p><p>He suddenly realized her 
intent eyes on him and pulled back his stern expression, knowing that he
 had spilled too much about him already. "What about you? How come I 
never see your father around?"</p><p> </p><p>"My father? Oh, he died when I was little." Ariel answered.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh..." Joe did not know how to respond.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah..." Ariel felt uncomfortable. "Anyway, come on, help me study. I have to get those high scores this time!"</p><p> </p><p>"All of the sudden, you're ambitious again?"</p><p> </p><p>"What?
 I have always been ambitious!" Ariel retorted. "It's just that 
yesterday I had no sleep trying to pacify Rainie and her broken heart. 
Do you have any idea how hard it was for me to finally convince her to 
go home the next morning?" she sighed, "I'm all used up."</p><p> </p><p>Revelations
 seemed to occupy Joe. He hadn't seen Rainie at all today so what she 
said could be true. "You weren't staying up to play video games?"</p><p> </p><p>"Please!" Ariel said, "Who the hell plays games all night long? Might end up getting a seizure or something."</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 suddenly felt guilty. Earlier, he had accused her of so many things, 
thinking that she was a lazy sloth who only knows how to play games. But
 now, he knew his thoughts of her were wrong and that she was just 
merely a good loyal friend. "I had no idea what a friend you are," he 
said, suddenly finding her very attractive.</p><p> </p><p>"What, jealous?" Ariel grinned. "Don't worry, when you're heartbroken, I'd be there for you too."</p><p> </p><p>Joe looked at her serious expression before bursting into guffaws. "Has anyone ever told you you're very cheesy?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel's
 mouth dropped as she gazed at him with disbelief. "Me? Cheesy? W-w-what
 are you talking about? Let me tell you!" She scooted closer to him, her
 face towards his. She was so uptight she didn't notice. "I'm a very 
cool person! It's just occasionally those uhh... 'cheesy' things slip, 
but they're heartfelt okay! I can't believe you made fun of me when I'm 
being very serious. Do you know how that makes me feel--"</p><p> </p><p>Joe,
 by now, wasn't even listening to a word she was saying. All he could 
pay attention to was the lips that were moving in fast motion, tempting 
him with its radiant glow and physical tenderness. He just noticed how 
full they were, and how peachy. He was sure she wasn't the type to use 
any sort of lip balm or gloss, but somehow, they were shiny as though 
she had. What was she blabbering about? Would she just shut up? He 
thought, eyes never leaving her lips.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, he moved 
in, instantly terminating all distance between their lips. Ariel's 
sentence got cut off as bewilderment thundered through her body like an 
electric shock.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Sorry
