<p class="tocn"></p><h4><!--Subtitle begin-->Confessions of the Heart<!--Subtitle end--></h4>
<!--Chapter begin-->
Jolin's words sped through Ariel's mind like an unstoppable racing car. 
She refused to believe in the idea that Joe may like her, but the more 
she considered Jolin's words, the more they made sense to her. She was 
right. You don't just kiss anyone you have no feelings for; even if 
someone asked you straight out for it, you just don't.<p>Her heart was 
thumping faster and faster as Ariel thought of the possibility. Jolin's 
fierceness had spanked her mind to think rationally. Right now, she 
wanted to confront Joe and ask him directly what the hell he was 
thinking when he returned her kiss. His face was so blank then but his 
eyes were expressive. Perhaps she misinterpreted them, but now she was 
willing to find out.</p><p>She was racing down the hallways, 
occasionally bumping into a few lingering bodies on the way, but in no 
way did it hinder her will to reach her destination. The music room.</p><p>Ariel
 knew he was in there because from ten feet away, she could hear the 
clear piano playing in a familiar tune. Her heart ached, knowing that 
the tune wasn't played for her, but she pushed it aside and continued 
forward. No matter what, she just had to choke out an answer from him.</p><p>She burst through the door, and there he was, perched on the seat in front of the piano.</p><p>She
 was panting loudly but her wheezing sound was lost in the melodious 
song. It was so sweet; she was sure that if anyone played the tune 
specifically for her, she'd melt right then and there.</p><p>She inched forward, her ears opening.</p><p>Suddenly, Joe stopped.</p><p>Ariel was staring at his back, wondering if he knew her presence.</p><p>"Are you here to give me a lashing?" Joe's cold voice sauntered to her ears, sending chills down her spine.</p><p>"No," she answered slowly, stepping closer. "I'm here to talk like a perfectly sane and civilized person."</p><p>"Okay, you have one minute."</p><p>Ariel's
 heart lurched fretfully. In a way, she felt like an idiot. Judging from
 his tone, it didn't sound like he wanted to listen to anything she had 
to say. Even with his back facing her, Ariel could sense his deadpanned 
expression, one that an average girl like her could never fathom. She 
could never guess what he could be thinking; he was a complete puzzle to
 her. Then again, maybe it was because he was so skillful when it came 
to hiding his emotions. Hadn't she accused him again and again that he 
was a fake?</p><p>Yet, she fell in love with such a person---a person 
who refused to express his feelings openly to anybody, who concealed his
 emotions deep within, and who was always bluntly cold toward her. Maybe
 it was because she had always been drawn to his mysteriousness. She 
loved playing that guessing game with him, didn't she? With her 
stubbornness, she had never abandoned him, but instead continuously 
thrived forward to reach out to him.</p><p>Even when he brushed her 
hands away, she still persisted. Part of the reason was due to the bet 
of course. The damned thing that started it all. But halfway through, 
the bet wasn't the only thing that occupied her mind. He. He was the 
other object that constantly invaded her head, terminating any effort to
 return to normality.</p><p>"Well?" He probed.</p><p>She gulped as panic
 threatened to consume her entirely. Why was it suddenly so hard to 
speak now? It was as though her voice just disappeared out of nowhere 
and it had to take her a moment to find it back as she rasped out, "I...
 I have something to ask you."</p><p>"Go ahead."</p><p>Wasn't he feeling
 anything at all? It always bothered her how he was able to remain cool 
and calm. Indifference had always been something he excelled to portray.
 For people like her, everything was just so blatantly obvious---her 
fears, her thoughts... They were easy to discern as though they were 
written all over her forehead.</p><p>"When you kissed me, what were you thinking?"</p><p>The
 moment she spat out those words, Ariel instantly wished she could take 
them back, think more thoroughly, and then rephrase so that it wouldn't 
sound so weird and awkward. However, what was to be asked had already 
been asked. Now she was just squirming in unease for his answer.</p><p>"What do you want me to say?"</p><p>She glared at his back. "The truth, of course!"</p><p>He
 whipped on his heels, his eyes now boring intensely into her amber 
ones. He approached her, facing her up close. Ariel could feel her 
thighs, knees, and calves turned into mush at the close proximity. 
Breathing threatened to stop. "What do you expect me to say?"</p><p>Her 
mind was so flustered, Ariel didn't know what to think. "I-I don't 
know... I just think that you must be thinking something when it 
happened. You know... just anything. Maybe I was too forceful…”</p><p>He chuckled softly at her, and it managed to put her at ease for a second. "You don't have to degrade yourself that way."</p><p>She gazed up at him. "Well, answer the damn question!"</p><p>"What if I don't want to?" He said.</p><p>"You..."
 How could he? She had swallowed her pride to come running back to him 
and ask politely, but he in return refused to answer? If there wasn't 
anything more infuriating than his tendency to conceal everything to 
himself! "Fine! Be that way!" Ariel snapped finally, shoving aside the 
reason why she came here in the first place. "I don't know why I was 
foolish to ever fall for a jerk like you. You know what, I don't care 
anymore! You can do whatever you want!" she fumed.</p><p>"You're leaving?"</p><p>Ariel
 turned away. "Yes! It's not like you care anyway, right? You might be 
exploding in relief that I am leaving you the hell alone!"</p><p>"You seem mad."</p><p>"Of
 course I am, you fool!" Ariel hissed. "You always ignore me. You always
 say stuff that hurt me. I hate you!" With one last huff, Ariel dashed 
toward the double doors, ready to leave and escape the despair and 
upsetting reality. She just wanted to go and find where she could hide 
herself, bury her embarrassment, and never come out to sunlight until 
all of this cruelty proved to be a just a plain nightmare.</p><p>His voice put a halt to her steps. "Stay."</p><p>"Why
 should I?" Ariel sniffed but she wasn't going to show him her tears. 
Hadn't she revealed enough about herself? Wasn't she ashamed enough?</p><p>"Listen to this song," he simply said and sat pensively on the stool as his fingers graced across the keys.</p><p>Ariel
 didn't want to, at first. She didn't want to listen to something that 
wasn't meant for her. Her legs were about to move along when all of a 
sudden, she stopped. Her ears picked up the notes as she listened 
carefully. There was something different about the song that tugged at 
her heartstrings. It wasn't the same song that she always caught him 
playing.It was more upbeat and lively. Before she knew it, her feet were
 riveted to the ground, and moving was almost impossible.</p><p>Two minutes passed by, and he finally stopped. Silence conquered the room.</p><p>Ariel
 scoffed under her breath. "I think you're playing it to the wrong 
person. I'm sure Selina would have been exhilarated to hear that." She 
began to move.</p><p>"Why do you think that?"</p><p>"What, you couldn't possibly play that for me," Ariel stated flatly, rolling her eyes.</p><p>"Funny," his voice said, "You're the only one listening."</p><p>She
 turned around, her eyes piercing. "All right. What do you want? I came 
here to talk to you, but you weren't cooperating. I leave, but you're 
not letting me. Mind telling me your motive?"</p><p>Joe didn't answer 
her. Again, his silence was grating her to no end. She watched as he got
 up from his seat and stood by the grand piano, looking down at the keys
 as his fingers wiped gracefully against them. "I had always loved piano
 since I was a child. It was the only form of expressing myself." There 
was a small pause as memories came flooding back to his mind. "Selina...
 She taught me how to play. She was a cute child back then, always so 
bubbly. She still is now."</p><p>Ariel couldn't believe that he was saying all of this. Did she look like she want to hear about his love story?</p><p>"I've
 always admired her because she seems to have everything I don't," he 
said solemnly. "But she didn't regard me as someone lower than her. In 
fact, she treated me quite the opposite, so caring, so sensitive. She 
was my only best friend back in primary school." There was a look of 
happiness on his face. It looked like whenever he mentioned Selina, he 
was able to express his adoration for her. "But then we separated and it
 was devastation for me. I had no one to talk to anymore. I've become 
depressed."</p><p>"She didn't know how I felt toward her, of course. 
Selina, that is." Joe continued. "It had always been my wishful 
thinking. How could a sunshine girl like her fall for a dark and gloomy 
boy like me? But still, I wanted to be by her side. I wanted to see her 
happy, because her smile brightened my days. But fate was cruel. My 
parents sent me to a new school, thinking that the bad environment had 
contributed to my autistic behavior. They didn't understand that I 
didn't want to go. They forced me. I hated them, then."</p><p>Even 
though, Ariel somewhat knew about his unhappy childhood, she had never 
expected that it would be so heartbreaking to hear. "Ever since then, I 
withdrew more from the world. I always brushed people off, thinking 
what's the use? Fate will probably make us friends, but it'll eventually
 tear us apart." He looked down on the piano again. "You see, even 
though I was in a new place, I never forget her. She was the only source
 to my sanity. Every day, I'd play piano. Playing it makes me feel at 
ease. It feels as though she's beside me."</p><p>Ariel felt her heart 
sank deeper and deeper into a pit of hopelessness. She was foolish to 
ever think that Joe could have any feelings toward her. Selina in his 
heart was irreplaceable.</p><p>"But you know what I found out?</p><p>Her ears perked up. "What?" she softly asked.</p><p>"All
 this while, I had been living in the past. I kept thinking about those 
days when I was happy to the extent that I forget about the present." He
 shook his head, as though pitying himself. "My admiration for Selina is
 undeniable, but what I have for her was supposed to be in the past. I 
didn't realize it yet until my birthday."</p><p>Ariel blinked. "Your birthday?"</p><p>"Well it should be, but I didn’t discover it until later."</p><p>"Oh? And what is that?" Ariel gulped in anticipation.</p><p>"I already love someone else."</p><p>Could
 he mean her? No... that couldn't be. Ariel refused to even harbor 
another hope. She'd just end up in severe disappointment. "Oh.. Good for
 you," she said flatly.</p><p>"Well?" Joe continued, raising his eyebrows. "Aren't you going to ask me who it is?"</p><p>"Can't be me," Ariel grumbled. "You've rejected me, remember?"</p><p>"I don't recall doing such thing."</p><p>"Don't play dumb," she snapped. "I kissed you, but you looked horrified. If that's not a sign, then I don't know what is."</p><p>"Have I ever told you you're rash in your conclusions?"</p><p>All
 of a sudden, Ariel felt unusual. The way he was staring at her was 
making her feel as though there were more meanings behind his words. She
 may not be academically inclined, but she wasn't stupid. "Are you 
trying to tell me something?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>Ariel paused, not 
knowing what to say. The possibility was flashing inside her mind but 
she was too weak and afraid to think of it.</p><p>Joe saw her struggle 
and said, "The song I just played... Selina has never heard it before. I
 actually composed the song, thinking about someone else. Someone who's 
alway expressive in the way she carries herself. She's a bit violent, 
too but her liveliness makes up for it. She's perky, pretty cute, but 
unfortunately, a little brainless sometimes."</p><p>Ariel's eyes jerked open. "Excuse me?"</p><p>Something flickered across Joe's face. "Even right now, she's still pretty clueless."</p><p>"What--"
 Ariel paused, things beginning to connect together. She had a feeling 
of what he was implying but fear disallowed her to think foolishly. 
Ariel blinked again, apprehension in her eyes. In a moment, a smirk ran 
across her face. "Okay, then. Ready to tell me what you think of my 
kiss?"</p><p>"It was sloppy," he said.</p><p>Ariel felt her blood pulsing. "Wei! You don't have to be that direct!" she yelled, feeling the colors shading her cheeks.</p><p>"I
 haven't finished yet," Joe said, surprising her. "You asked me what I 
was thinking right? Here's my answer.My mind was pretty much blank 
then."</p><p>God... so she went through all that troubles just to get him to tell her that his mind was blank!?</p><p>"But you know what?" Joe continued. "My heart was racing."</p><p>Ariel suddenly froze. "Huh?"</p><p>"Yeah.
 It was," he confessed. If she did not mistaken, did she just discern a 
tinge of shyness on his face? "I never had that feeling before. Not even
 Selina made me feel that way." Okay... so this was a little 
unexpectant. Ariel wasn't sure if she was ready to hear it. How 
contradictory. Awhile ago, she was wishing for him to give her an answer
 that would make her leaping in joy, but right now, she somewhat dreaded
 hearing his voice. Maybe she was nervous? Maybe she was scared that it 
was again a false hope?</p><p>"Ahem. Okay..." Ariel felt a little awkward.</p><p>He pinned his eyes on her, causing her to almost have a heart attack. "You get what I mean, Ariel?"</p><p>"No...
 No, I don't," she said honestly, unsure. "Do you mean that you... like 
me?" God. Saying those words felt so childish. It was like they were 
little kids, confessing their feelings to each other. But then again, 
when does love ever discriminate? Young or old, children or adults, love
 can definitely wedge its way in without one's knowing. Mysterious and 
wondrous, wasn't that how love was?</p><p>He smirked at her. "Finally, got it huh? You're slower than I thought."</p><p>Her
 cheeks fumed. "Don't start, again!" She hissed, crossing her arms. 
Then, suddenly, her mind began registering. "Wait... what?"</p><p>"God, you're really stupid."</p><p>Ariel brushed off his insults, her need to understand growing more intensely. "But how?"</p><p>"I don't know," Joe said. "I guess your idiocy does rub off on me, so I've become an idiot without even realizing it."</p><p>"Hah! The genius admits that he's an idiot!" Ariel laughed, happiness suddenly invading her entire body.</p><p>“You
 make me feel good.” It took her awhile to figure that he was still 
explaining why he liked her. “I don’t know. But I just feel really 
comfortable around you. With you, I can almost spill any secrets.”</p><p>Ariel took notice of the ‘almost’ and was tempted to find out what it meant. “And…”</p><p>“And what?” he smugly smiled at her.</p><p>“What thing haven’t you told me?”</p><p>“You’re not that stupid,” he suddenly switched the topic. “You’re actually quite smart if you put in the effort.”</p><p>Ariel
 blushed. It wasn’t an everyday thing that Joe Cheng complimented you. 
“Of course, I have always known that…” she couldn’t help but boast.</p><p>“Really? Then why do you always get upset when I call you stupid?” He teased her.</p><p>Redness
 crept up to her face, but Ariel managed to hit him in the arm. “Wei! 
Why are you switching the topic! You didn’t answer my question!” She 
bawled.</p><p>“What question? I’ve answered them all.”</p><p>Ariel was about to blow up. “I’m really going to lose it-”</p><p>“I already told you all my secrets.”</p><p>Ariel looked at him, finally realizing it. “Oh…”</p><p>He only smirked at her.</p><p>"Well...
 umm.... what am I supposed to do or say now?" Although this wasn't her 
first time taking on a relationship, Ariel still considered herself 
inexperienced. Now she resembled a lost puppy. "What happened when I was
 with Mike?" she pondered out loud, plastering on a thinking face. He 
was after all her only boyfriend in her entire seventeen years of life.</p><p>Joe
 was suddenly beside her. Ariel almost jumped up in startling fright. 
"You know, mentioning about your ex does grate on your boyfriend's 
nerves."</p><p>Ariel blushed at his direct implication. Suddenly her 
face perked up. "Hey... is that why you've always acted so grouchy 
around me? Because you know that I was only after you because of Mike?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Come
 on! You must be, huh?" Ariel smiled as she continued teasing. "I 
mean... You probably fell for me about the same time as I did for you. 
But we didn't realize that yet. And I was always bringing up about the 
bet... Hmmm... Very fishy...."</p><p>"Come on. It's late. Let's go home," said Joe.</p><p>She trailed after him persistently. "Tell me! Am I right?"</p><p>"No--"</p><p>"Liar! Now that I think about it, it makes a whole lot of sense why you're always acting cold toward me--"</p><p>"Shut up, or I'll kiss you," he said.</p><p>Ariel
 gasped at the sudden closeness of his face, her heart thumping in an 
abnormal pace. Even though they were "official" now, there was still a 
feeling of awkwardness between them. She needed time to mold into this 
relationship and his sudden fierceness in expressing the idea of kissing
 her was frightening her bit.</p><p>Suddenly, he laughed. In the months 
of knowing him, she had never heard him laugh so heartily before. It 
made her smile that she was able to have that influence on him, but she 
hid her content as she feigned a pout. "Are you laughing at me?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"Gee,
 thanks." She mumbled sarcastically. "I have a boyfriend who constantly 
teases and insults me. I feel like the luckiest girl in the world."</p><p>"Quit moping."</p><p>"Oh, but I can't help it," Ariel said. "If someone doesn't insensitively says things that hurt me, maybe I wouldn't be."</p><p>Joe was now staring at her with an intensity Ariel found unusual. "Have I always appeared that mean to you?"</p><p>"You want the truth?"</p><p>"Mm hmm."</p><p>"Yes,"
 Ariel breathed out. His face looked sullen for a second, as though he 
was trying to recall the moments in which he exercised barbarism toward 
her. A faint smile curled up on Ariel's lips as she continued, "But you 
know what? I fell in love you with that way. If you hadn't been mean to 
me, our relationship wouldn't exist. We would just be a boring 'fake' 
couple."</p><p>Joe smirked at her. "Oh, was that a compliment?"</p><p>"Don't get cocky," she snapped.</p><p>They
 sauntered down the empty hallways in silence, appreciating the moment 
to themselves. Never would they think that things would end up this way,
 but indeed, life was full of surprises. A worthless and ridiculous deal
 made by two bored teenager girls actually had altered a turning point 
in two people's lives.</p><p>Suddenly, something hurled at Ariel. "Joe?"</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"What about Selina?"</p><p>The
 name hung in the air between them, hailing a moment of tension. Ariel 
knew how important Selina was to him and to request that he completely 
forget her would be absurd. Despite their relationship, Ariel didn't 
think she had the right to control his life. Even though it may sadden 
her, but Ariel was willing to accept anything he was about to tell her.</p><p>"It's
 a big mess now, isn't it?" She asked, remembering when Selina leaned in
 to kiss him. Perhaps she was right with her persistence in thinking 
that Selina had always treated Joe more than a brother. After what she 
saw, Ariel was convinced Selina did have feelings for Joe. "What are we 
going to do?"</p><p>"We'll just have to carry on," he simply said.</p><p>"Do you still like her?" Ariel asked softly, scared to hear the truth.</p><p>"Yes," he said.</p><p>Ariel
 instantly withdrew her arms, feeling the tears forming in the corner of
 her eyes. "Oh... Well.. Maybe you should tell her to be your girlfriend
 then." She couldn't help but sound like a jealous possessive partner, 
but Ariel had limits when it came to relationships. As far as she was 
concerned, she wasn't about to be willing to share her man.</p><p>Joe 
grabbed her shoulders, staring into her eyes. She felt naked under his 
intense gaze because she knew he could read everything. "Selina is a 
very important person in my life." Ariel had to look away now. She 
couldn't bear to see how his enamored eyes would spark. "But..."</p><p>Ariel waited for an answer, her heart beating rapidly.</p><p>"My feelings toward her had always been admiration and appreciation," he said. "It had never been anything more than that."</p><p>Now her eyes were wide open. "Really? But on your birthday, you clearly said--"</p><p>"I misunderstood myself," he cut her.</p><p>"Oh..." Ariel didn't know what to say. "So now what? Selina clearly does reciprocate your feelings."</p><p>"I don't want to hurt her," Joe said, "But it'll just have to be."</p><p>Ariel
 nodded in agreement, not knowing what else to say. After a few short 
silence, she spat out quickly, "Are you going to tell her?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>Now the idea sounded absurd to her. "But.. wouldn't that be too cruel? She is a girl after all. It would be hard--"</p><p>"Do you rather have me hurt you?" Joe asked.</p><p>Ariel looked away. "I don't know."</p><p>"Don't worry about. Selina will understand," Joe said soothingly in an attempt to assure her.</p><p>As
 they proceeded, Ariel couldn't help but imagine all kind of scenarios 
in her mind. No matter how much Joe assured her that he felt nothing 
romantic with Selina, Ariel couldn't help doubting him.</p><p>Stop thinking, she scolded herself. You must trust Joe.</p><p>Yes she must.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------</p><p>One
