</p><p class="tocn"></p><h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="tocn"></p><h4><!--Subtitle begin-->How to Seize Your Chance (and humiliate yourself)<!--Subtitle end--></h4>
<!--Chapter begin-->
“For the last time, NO!”<p> </p><p>Ariel broke free from Rainie’s 
suffocating grasp. She tried to pay attention to the boring musical show
 but her friend would not let her. Well, that was expected. When Rainie 
got bored, she’d go crazily hyper and jumpy at the expense of her 
audience’s sanity.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on, Ariel,” Rainie drawled. “You 
have to take on my challenge. I think it’s the best one I’ve come up for
 the past seventeen years of my life!”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, so you’ve been making up challenges since you were born?” Ariel asked sarcastically.</p><p> </p><p>“I was born to rock your world, Ariel dear,” Rainie said a bit too sweetly. Ariel felt her skin crawl with goose bumps.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want to.”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t be so stubborn.”</p><p> </p><p>“No means no!”</p><p> </p><p>“SHH!
 Lower your voice.” Gillian hushed the two, losing her patience. “I’m 
trying to watch the show.” But no matter how absorbed she was by the 
classical music, she still spared some of her consciousness towards what
 the two were discussing about. “But keep going.”</p><p> </p><p>Ariel and Rainie rolled their eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on, why not?” Rainie whined, not willing to submit.</p><p> </p><p>“Why should I?!” Ariel retorted.</p><p> </p><p>“Because… Because my life is boring,” Rainie replied. “Help me make it more entertaining?” </p><p> </p><p>How
 far could one go for entertainment? It was a question impossible for 
Ariel to answer before, but now it couldn't be more obvious. “But I’m 
not ready to date--”</p><p> </p><p>“Besides,” Rainie continued without 
letting the girl finish. “You never turn down any of my challenges. Why 
are you so stubborn this time? Unless…” Her eyes narrowed as suspicion 
blared all across her face. “Unless… you’re still not over Mike.” She 
finished with an air of mystification.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel’s eyes 
widened like saucers. “No!” She practically screamed, catching on the 
attention of the teachers standing nearby. “I mean, please. I am over 
him three months ago.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s what you say,” Rainie said,
 “But in your heart…” She trailed her finger and pointed it at Ariel’s 
heart, just for the sake of suspense. “You’re pining for him. Listen, I 
can hear the desirous beating of your heart. Thump, thump, thump—“</p><p> </p><p>Ariel slapped her finger away.  “Forget it, Rainie. I’m not going to-”</p><p> </p><p>“Why
 not, Ariel?” Gillian spoke, her eyes still glued to the kid playing the
 clarinet with skills on stage. “You haven’t had a boyfriend for three 
months. Don’t you miss having a relationship?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t see YOU going out with anybody-”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re
 definitely not over your ex,” Gillian concluded. “When a person is 
unwilling to get into a new relationship, it means they’re still living 
in the shadows of the previous one-”</p><p> </p><p>“I am not!” Ariel cried. “What do you know about relationships, anyway, Gillian?”</p><p> </p><p>“Prove it,” Rainie said with a grin. “Are you really over your ex? Date the school’s cold prince and prove it.”</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 looked infuriatingly at her two friends, who were mulishly resolute on 
pushing her against the wall. She was sick of having people assume that 
she was still in love with Mike. For God’s sake, he had a new girlfriend
 already! He was probably having the hell of his time making out with 
her at this moment. My God. That was right. While he was having fun, 
what was she doing? Rotting in the singledom.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine. You 
want proof, you got it. I’ll take your stupid challenge,” Ariel decided,
 instantly injecting excitement in her friends’ nerves. She was 
determined to show everyone including Mike that she was completely and 
absolutely OVER him.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes! Now this is the Ariel I know!” Rainie squealed.</p><p> </p><p>“SHHH!” The teachers shot the girls daggers.</p><p> </p><p>“But why the cold prince?” Ariel asked, whispering. She remembered her top three reasons why she wouldn’t date him.</p><p> </p><p>“Because he is the most challenging, duh!”</p><p> </p><p>“But--“</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,
 so here are the rules.” Rainie didn't even let the poor Ariel finish 
her sentence. “You have to ask him out. We all know that the cold prince
 will reject anybody that asks him out; so therefore the real challenge 
is to come up with a way to make him NOT reject you.”</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 let out a big sigh, but it went unknown to the excited talking Rainie, 
oblivious to everything but her own voice. There was just simply no way 
to turn this down judging from Rainie's persistent character. “You have 
three months to do it. We'll end it right on Valentine's Day. If you win
 this, then you totally proved to us that you are over Mike. I'll kneel 
down to you three times.” Rainie's eyes brightened up. But the spark in 
them told Ariel that Rainie was confident that she was going to LOSE 
this time.</p><p> </p><p>“If you lose however...” Rainie trailed off in 
suspense, eyeing Ariel with sinister thoughts. “You're going to have to 
strip in front of the entire school.”</p><p> </p><p>"What?!" Ariel and Gillian both shouted, eyes inflating to the size of balloons.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie laughed humorously. "Oh, look at you two! I was kidding!"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel shot daggers at her friend. "How dare you joke like that! My reputation is not to be tainted with! Hmphh."</p><p> </p><p>"C'mon,
 can't you take a joke," Rainie poked her friend. "Okay, if you lose, 
you're going to have to pose in a bikini for our class to see."</p><p> </p><p>"What is the difference from the one before?!" Ariel shouted, outraged. "Rainie! Sometimes, I doubt that you're my friend!"</p><p> </p><p>"Hey!!"
 Rainie rebuked. "You say that again! The reason I'm so persistent with 
this challenge is to help you get over Mike! I'm not a friend?" She let 
of a heavy angry scoff.</p><p> </p><p>"If you were my friend, you'd know that I was over Mike long ago!"</p><p> </p><p>"No! It's because I'm your friend that I know you're NOT over Mike!"</p><p> </p><p>The
 girls looked at each other with a hot glare before tearing their eyes 
from each other. To demonstrate their discontent and adversary, they 
crossed their arms. This scene was so familiar that Gillian had to 
suppress a sigh. Ever since they were friends, Rainie and Ariel had a 
habit of arguing every now and then, relentless and stubborn as mules. 
It would take more than a cow to make one of them submit defeat to the 
other. And even if one of them did, the compromise was bloody.</p><p> </p><p>Gillian
 tugged on both of her friends, wanting to cease the growing fire. 
"Hush! The teachers are looking at us. Stop your childish feud, please?"</p><p> </p><p>"Tell her to go to hell, please?!" Ariel asked Gillian.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie's eyes widened. "Gillian. Tell HER to go to hell please?!"</p><p> </p><p>Gillian
 sighed. She could feel a headache surfacing at her friends' pettiness. 
"You two resemble a married couple!" She commented, knowing the remark 
will toss both girls in disgust.</p><p> </p><p>"No way!" Both girls cried.</p><p> </p><p>"See,
 that's why you two shouldn't fight," Gillian reasoned. "Now, let's talk
 like the civilized people we are. Get back to the challenge."</p><p> </p><p>Rainie and Ariel exchanged glances, but they both obliged Gillian's order, since they knew the fight will get them nowhere.</p><p> </p><p>"As
 I was saying..." Rainie trailed off, seeing Ariel's sharp gaze on her. 
"Okay fine... I'll change the conditions. If you lose.... hmmm." She 
scrunched in deep thought, trying to rack her brain for an appropriate 
but interesting punishment. She had always been a person who'd go for 
the craziest and funniest experiments and no way was she going to let 
this challenge launch off with boring conditions. "You have to kiss my 
brother."</p><p> </p><p>"RAINIE!!" Both girls screeched.</p><p> </p><p>"Okay,
 fine, fine! The loser will have to sing children nursery rhymes for the
 whole school to hear!!" Rainie sighed with disappointment.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel grinned with satisfaction.</p><p> </p><p>"That's better," Gillian approved.</p><p> </p><p>"Deal," Ariel said.</p><p> </p><p>"Man, you guys are so boring!" screamed Rainie.</p><p> </p><p>Before
 the girl could complain any further, the MC announced that Joe Cheng 
was going to play a piano piece. Almost instantly, Ariel saw everyone 
snapping their eyes open as though his name was a magic wand that cast 
the awakening spell. Ariel, too, was intrigued.</p><p> </p><p>Joe bowed 
to the audience with an indecipherable expression. Ariel studied him. 
Okay, so he wasn’t bad looking, but he wasn’t that spectacular either. 
She wondered why the whole school was so smitten with this guy. What, 
did he have some cute foxy ears that everybody else didn’t?</p><p> </p><p>He
 sat at the piano, seemingly absorbed in his own world as his fingers 
ran across the keyboard, producing enchanting music that enamored the 
crowds. Ariel looked at him, stunned. He was the so-called Cold Prince 
of the school, yet right now, she discerned neither coldness nor 
arrogance from him. In fact, he seemed as though he was a person of 
warmth and emotions--an image that shocked Ariel. Ariel was mesmerized 
as she allowed his beautiful music to travel through her ears.</p><p> </p><p>His
 piece was so poignant she could feel her heart prick along with the 
tears it was crying. She watched Joe as he slid his fingers against the 
piano with a passion she never knew existed. Somehow, it brought 
memories of Mike back into her mind, overwhelming her with abrasive 
emotions.</p><p> </p><p>How could a person who always appeared frosty play such an evoking piece?</p><p> </p><p>It was as if he had suffered a pain similar to hers…</p><p> </p><p>When he finished the piece, the whole auditorium bounced off with loud applause. Ariel found herself clapping along.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh
 my God! Not only is he a champion at basketball, he’s a star at playing
 the piano! Where do you find such a guy!?” Rainie squealed. “Now, 
aren’t you glad you took the challenge? That Joe Cheng doesn’t seem that
 ruthless as people claimed.”</p><p> </p><p>“I guess not…” Ariel found herself already warming up to him.</p><p> </p><p>“Ariel, don’t you reckon you should go backstage now?” Rainie asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Huh? Why?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’d
 better get you started before you back down on the challenge. You have 
to seize your chance! There’s probably a mob of girls back there waiting
 for him. Go!”</p><p> </p><p>“But…” Ariel stuttered, not at all prepared. “This is too abrupt! He’s going to reject me straight out!”</p><p> </p><p>“Not
 if you use tricks!” Rainie giggled. “Here, pull your skirt up a bit… 
and unbutton the first few buttons of your blouse… Yeah that’s right. 
You looking sexy, mama.”</p><p> </p><p>Ariel slapped Rainie’s roaming hands away. “Mind you, I am NOT prostituting myself for a bet!”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm, I don’t think Ariel stands a chance,” Gillian scrutinized, pushing up her glasses.</p><p> </p><p>“And why not, Miss Know-It-All,” Rainie asked.</p><p> </p><p>“If you come up to him like this, he’d probably just think you’re a slut. Before you know it, he’d push you out of his sight.”</p><p> </p><p>Ariel and Rainie exchanged glances. “Then, what do you suggest her to do?”</p><p> </p><p>“He
 rejects anybody who asks him out. God knows how many hearts he’d 
broken. By now, he has probably already encountered all the possible 
courting scenes. If you want to win, you’d have to do something 
different. Something he has never encountered before…”</p><p> </p><p>“Get to the point!” Rainie snapped.</p><p> </p><p>“At
 this rate, there’s only one thing we can do,” Gillian said with Rainie 
tapping her fingers on the armrest. “Use the guilt card.”</p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Ariel
 could not believe she was doing this. This was outrageous. She had just
 only regretted her stupid decision when all the adrenaline faded.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie,
 that girl! How in the world did Ariel end up with having her as a best 
friend? There was a growing desire to turn back but when she imagined 
how Rainie would react, Ariel immediately shuddered away the thought. 
She had already come this far. Only a coward would quit now. And she 
wasn’t that.</p><p> </p><p>The mob of girls were screaming Joe’s name, 
waving banners. Ariel couldn’t believe the chaotic sight. Was Joe an 
upcoming star or what?! With that kind of fandom, Ariel couldn’t resist 
thinking so.</p><p> </p><p>Okay, gotta drive those girls away… Ariel thought. She snapped her fingers when an idea hit her.</p><p> </p><p>“GIRLS,
 GIRLS!” Ariel screamed, making her way through the crowd. “I heard that
 Joe just snuck out through the south exit! He was with a girl! Can you 
believe that?! We must get them back. Come on, let’s go!” Ariel waved 
her hands towards the south and all the girls sauntered towards the exit
 in aggravation and bashing of the anonymous (imaginary for Ariel) girl.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 snickered as she ventured into the interior of the backstage. It took 
her quite a few minutes, but once she caught sight of him talking to a 
teacher, Ariel’s heart thrashed.</p><p> </p><p>‘Okay, calm down Ariel. 
I’ll just have to pretend bumping into him. And then, I’ll cry him a 
river. He’d feel guilty, and before I know it, he’d fall in love with 
me.’ Ariel couldn’t help but giggle.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel readied herself
 in her position. She took a peek, seeing him heading straight at her 
direction. She was nervous as heck. Sucking in a breath, she counted 
one, two, three….</p><p> </p><p>And dashed out of her position.</p><p> </p><p>CRASH!!!!!</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 smacked right into a cabinet at a speed of a racing car. It shook and 
rattled as shock traveled through every part of its interior. But the 
real sufferer wasn’t the cabinet but the wordless Ariel who was stunned 
(and pained) out of her wits.</p><p> </p><p>Oh my god… wrong target! She thought inside her head.</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 had staggered back several steps when she bolted out. Surprise was 
evident on his face, but it quickly disappeared when it emerged. He only
 stood there and observed her.</p><p> </p><p>‘Get up, quick!’ She 
ordered herself. Ariel quickly snapped out of her trance and let out a 
bellowing cry, improvising crazily in her head.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my 
god! My hands! My hands!” Ariel squealed pretending that her hands were 
broken. “Painful, painful!! My god, they’re broken! Broken…” she wept.</p><p> </p><p>Joe only looked at her with a bored glance.</p><p> </p><p>“My
 beautiful hands!” She wailed exaggeratedly. “How will I ever play the 
piano again? My god, my dream’s gone… Gone… Just like that…”</p><p> </p><p>From
 the corner of her eyes, she glimpsed him rolling his eyes. ‘Crap, was 
my acting that bad?’ Ariel thought with a worried expression.</p><p> </p><p>Joe didn’t pay any more attention to her. Tossing his hands into his pockets, he strode right pass her.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 froze for a millisecond before she registered what just happened. Did 
he just blatantly ignore her after all of her crying? Ariel could not 
contain her disbelief. He could have at least asked her if she was okay!
 For God’s sake, she did crash into a hard object!</p><p> </p><p>But 
false to what she hoped, Joe did not turn back. Angry at his snobby 
behavior and negligence, Ariel found herself storming towards behind him
 with a finger pointed at his back. “Wei! You stop right there!” She 
yelled.</p><p> </p><p>Surprisingly he did.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel took the chance to stomp in front of him. “Did you notice how hurt I was?! Why didn’t you say anything?”</p><p> </p><p>Joe chucked her an odd glance, but she couldn’t decipher much of it. “That’s your business,” he coldly said.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel was stunned for a moment. “What do you mean it’s my business? For your information, it was YOUR fault!” She snapped.</p><p> </p><p>“Funny, I didn’t make you crash into that cabinet.”</p><p> </p><p>Ariel pointed a finger at him, revulsion thundering down her nerves. “You…”</p><p> </p><p>“I thought you said your hands were broken?” Joe asked in a taunting tone.</p><p> </p><p>She quickly hid her hands behind her, spluttering for something to say. “S-say sorry now!”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t
 you have anything better to do? You put in so much to act all of that 
shit out to do what? Get my attention? For your information, I don’t say
 sorry to people like you.” With a cold glare that gnawed all electrical
 activity of her heart, he sauntered away.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel whipped 
around, staring at his retreating back with multiplied resentment 
thundering down her nerves. Even the way he walked spoke of majestic 
arrogance! She couldn’t believe how much she humiliated herself for him,
 how she brainlessly said crap.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, he stopped in 
his tracks. “Oh yeah. If you were planning to ask me out, well, sorry to
 break it to you, but I’m going to have to reject you.”</p><p>Ariel’s 
eyes widened, bewildered at his assumption. But what angered her the 
most was his tone that rang with deafening insincerity.</p><p> </p><p>He
 didn't even sound apologetic. If anything, he sounded like he didn't 
give a damn. Although Ariel harbored no real feelings for this man, his 
harsh rejection hurt nonetheless. It suddenly occurred to her that she 
was like the other girls at their school. It was just her turn right now
 to suffer what they had.</p><p> </p><p>“Wei! You got it wrong mister! I
 didn’t ask you out, so technically, you didn’t reject me!” Ariel yelled
 with all of her might, anger pouring out through her words.</p><p> </p><p>She
 breathed rapidly as she witnessed his wordless leave. He was so 
confident of himself that he assumed she was chasing after him. How 
infuriating! Ariel had never felt so insulted in her span of seventeen 
years of life. As she sucked in a breath, the reality of the situation 
finally slammed down upon her, making her shake with hard realization.</p><p> </p><p>For the next three months, she was going to have to pursue him, the alleged Cold Prince.</p><p> </p><p>Oh God, what had she done to herself?</p><p>----------------------------------------</p><p>Hi you guys.
