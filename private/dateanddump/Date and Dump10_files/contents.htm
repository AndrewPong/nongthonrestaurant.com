<p class="tocn"></p><h4><!--Subtitle begin-->The Date and Dump Contract<!--Subtitle end--></h4>
<!--Chapter begin-->
Ariel grumbled as she sauntered her way down the hallways. Old Mr. Wang 
had given her detention earlier that day because he caught her asleep in
 class. She didn't know what made the old man snap. Normally, he bore a 
friendly front, having no backbone to go against anybody, but it seemed 
like his bad mood was her misfortune today.<p> </p><p>It didn't matter. The hellish hour was over anyway. Ariel had never been so glad to see the hallways in school.</p><p> </p><p>She decided to head to her locker first to fish out her math book. She didn't expect to see the grim face of Jolin Tsai.</p><p> </p><p>And her two sidekicks.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 raised an eyebrow, wondering what could be the reason to their 
presence. She didn't like Jolin. Everything about the girl spelled out 
high-class bitch and if anything, Ariel didn't like to associate with 
that kind of people.</p><p> </p><p>She purposely ignored the grating looks sent her way.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey! How dare you ignore Jolin?" Sidekick #1 blared coarsely.</p><p> </p><p>"Do you know how long we waited for your scrawny ass?" said the other one.</p><p> </p><p>Jolin was smirking vengefully, the ugliness of her character clearly shown. "My... Poor you. Is it your first detention?"</p><p> </p><p>Something
 about her tone made the hair on Ariel's neck stood up. God, how could 
people like her exist? She totally disgraced the whole population of 
females with her scratchy voice and vulgar manners.</p><p> </p><p>"To what honor do I owe your visit?" Ariel asked bluntly, opening her locker.</p><p> </p><p>Jolin
 crossed her arms, the mug look never leaving her face. "I don't like 
beating around the bush so I'm just going to say it straight out. Do you
 ever look yourself in the mirror? My, my, my. Someone like you is far 
from suitable for Joe. Why don't you take the hint and back down?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel scoffed. "Do I sense jealousy?"</p><p> </p><p>Two
 meancing eyebrows drew together. "Are you kidding me? Why would I be 
jealous of YOU? Seeing that we're both girls, I don't blame that you're 
smitten about Joe. But I'm just giving you an advice. He is not serious 
about you. Leave him before you suffer from a heartbreak."</p><p> </p><p>The
 girl was speaking as though she had undergone the some type of 
traumatic experience. Coming from someone else, Ariel would find her 
suggestion a nice gesture but considering it was Jolin, Ariel quickly 
dumped the thought. </p><p> </p><p>"Please, even if I leave him, Joe wouldn't go out with you."</p><p> </p><p>"What
 do you say?!" Sidekick #1 quickly came to Jolin's defense. "Someone as 
pretty as Jolin will definitely catch the eyes of many guys. Let alone 
just a Joe."</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. Watch your words, bitch," sidekick #2 followed.</p><p> </p><p>Jolin
 grinned widely, satisfied with her accomplices' performances. "Now, 
now, guys. Don't frighten the girl. Remember, we're here for a noble 
cause."</p><p> </p><p>"'Noble' cause?" Ariel repeated, wanting to laugh. "Don't you have a life?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel's
 indifference was starting to grate Jolin more and more. It seemed like 
her plan to threaten the girl to surrender wasn't working very well. 
Ariel was sure she could hear Jolin's jaw clenching audibly to a point 
she was afraid it'd snap into two.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, Jolin showed 
her true colors. "Listen here, you bitch! Stay away from Joe! An ugly 
gal like you should go off with a begger on the street or something!"</p><p> </p><p>"Look,
 I don't need your damn opinion," Ariel snapped irritably. "Before you 
call someone ugly, try to take a look at yourself in the mirror without 
the pounds of make-up! Who knows! Maybe you'll be shocked!"</p><p> </p><p>"How dare you!" Jolin screeched like a monkey, cheeks flushing in deep crimson red. "Guys! Show her what you're made of!"</p><p> </p><p>Jolin's
 sidekicks exchanged a secretive glance, their dark evil eyes shining in
 vehemence, symbolizing their thrist for violence. Ariel was sure she 
could hear their knuckles cracking loud in taunting sounds. The look on 
their faces were hard and shady like stones.</p><p> </p><p>"Don't you 
dare do anything absurd. This is school ground," Ariel warned. She found
 herself inching back further and further that she knocked against the 
locker behind her.</p><p> </p><p>"Please. You think I'm afraid of that?"
 Jolin sneered. "In case you've been living under the rock, my father 
happens to be the number one sponser for this school. Even if I burn 
down this whole worn out building, they won't be able to do anything 
about it!"</p><p> </p><p>"You can't escape the police!" Ariel yelled in an attempt to scare them, but her effort was fruitless. "Get away from me!"</p><p> </p><p>Jolin
 suddenly laughed out loud, feeling satisfaction coursing through her 
body at Ariel's frightened expression. Her sidekicks burst out in peals 
of laughter along with her.</p><p> </p><p>"HAHAHA. You actually fell for
 it!!" Jolin screeched. "You should have seen your stupid look! So after
 all, the girl Joe likes is a wimp!"</p><p> </p><p>"Who are you calling a
 wimp?" Ariel was maddened by their childish antics. The fact that they 
could take this as a joke further drained her patience and ignited her 
anger. "You guys seriously have nothing better to do, huh?"</p><p> </p><p>Jolin rolled her eyes. "Please. It's not like a low girl like you have so much of a life either."</p><p> </p><p>"At least I'm not a useless mob of garbage."</p><p> </p><p>"What did you just say?" Jolin shot angrily.</p><p> </p><p>Her
 sidekicks, getting defensive on behalf of their mistress, stomped 
forward in unison. Such spontaneous movement would normally startle 
Ariel but after being fooled once, she wasn't about to fall for the same
 trap twice.</p><p> </p><p>"I said, you're a piece of garbage!" Ariel spat indignantly. "Garbage, garbage, garbage!!!"</p><p> </p><p>"I'm not garbage!" Jolin shrieked outrageously.</p><p> </p><p>"Sure you are! Look at your face! It's garbage, garbage, garbage! I bet your brains is made of the same type of garbage!"</p><p> </p><p>"You--" Jolin's face was so red, it almost resembled a big fat tomatoe. "How dare you! No one has ever insulted me before!"</p><p> </p><p>"I'll do it again!" Ariel yelled.</p><p> </p><p>It
 was the final blow for Jolin. Never in her life had anyone dare agitate
 her this much. The sudden overwhelming burst of exasperation made her 
nerves pump so hard; Jolin drew up a hand without realizing it. In a 
snap of a finger, she delivered Ariel a big hard SLAP.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 glared at her with piercing eyes. Being hit by spoiled, nasty princess 
further exacerbated her humiliation, and if anything, Ariel was 
violently stimulated. In a quick swift motion, she returned the SLAP!</p><p> </p><p>"Bitch!" Jolin screamed as her sidekicks readied in position for defense.</p><p> </p><p>"You're the bitch!" Ariel fired back, her mind a turmoil of aggravation.</p><p> </p><p>Jolin
 launched forward unexpectedly, tugging and pulling mercilessly at 
Ariel's hair. However, her high heels caused her inconveniency as she 
clumsily tripped over the heel of her foot. Jolin came crashing down to 
the floor, but she wasn't about to suffer alone because she 
instinctually grabbed Ariel's arm and yanked her down too.</p><p> </p><p>Both girls yelped out in pain upon the cold contact with the hard surface.</p><p> </p><p>However,
 all momentary pain was left ignored as both girls indulged in a cat 
fight. Jolin stubbornly yanked at Ariel's hair as though it was all she 
could do while Ariel tried desperately to push her weight off. Ariel 
felt Jolin's advancing nails digging into her skin and cried even 
louder.</p><p> </p><p>"Screw you bitch! Don't you ever touch me like this!!" Jolin screamed. "Guys! Fucking help here!"</p><p> </p><p>Her sidekicks quickly obeyed to her command as they dropped to the floor and advanced on Ariel.</p><p> </p><p>"You all are despicable!" Ariel shouted. "Get off of me!"</p><p> </p><p>Jolin
 grabbed Ariel's head. "You think you're so great huh? Well think again,
 bitch!!!" Overwhelmed with fury, Jolin's impulsive mind paid no heed to
 the consequences her actions might trigger. All she cared about was her
 current thirst for revenge as she raised Ariel's head. She didn't know 
where the strength came from but in only a split second out of mere 
rage, she successfully whammed Ariel's face against the metal face of 
the lockers.</p><p> </p><p>Her sidekicks gasped.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel's 
head felt heavy, but she could feel the throbbing pain on her face. It 
took her a moment before she could refocus her eyesight.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh my god! She's bleeding!" one of the sidekicks pointed out.</p><p> </p><p>"Please.
 That wasn't even hard..." Jolin said, finally gaining composure. 
However, her voice trailed off once she spotted the flowing red rivers 
from Ariel's nose. "Oh my god! This is disgusting!!!"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 whimpered, the pain becoming more and more evident. Instinctually, her 
hands flew to her nose. She could feel more blood gushing out 
uncontrollably.</p><p> </p><p>Jolin seemed shocked and panic consumed 
her. "Look... I-I didn't mean to do that. It just came... I mean... you 
shouldn't have aggravated me!"</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah! You're the one that started it!" Sidekick #1 said.</p><p> </p><p>"It's your fault. Not ours," stated the other.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 couldn't register what they were saying. All she knew was that her nose
 was hurting so much; she wanted to cry. But no tears would come out.</p><p> </p><p>"Wei! What are you all doing?"</p><p> </p><p>Jolin
 gasped out in horror upon recognizing the voice. The owner of the voice
 quickly dashed toward the scene and bent down to the victim. It was 
Joe. Jolin's fear and worries heightened to the highest degrees. "J-Joe!
 What are you doing here? I-I didn't mean to hurt her! She called me 
garbage, and I-I was so mad, I didn't know I was doing. I just--" She 
was clearly hyperventilating.</p><p> </p><p>Joe shot her a maddening 
grimace, not believing the extent of her absurdity. He always knew she 
had a knack for some of the most outrageous stunts, but this was going 
too far.</p><p> </p><p>"Can you hear me, Ariel?" Joe said, slapping Ariel's cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel fluttered her eyes open. "Pain.. Pain."</p><p> </p><p>Joe quickly picked her up in his arms.</p><p> </p><p>"W-where are you taking her?" Jolin asked, still panicking. She feared that she might be causing big troubles this time.</p><p> </p><p>Joe rolled his eyes. "The nurse office."</p><p> </p><p>Before
 she knew it, Ariel felt her body being carried down the hallways. She 
heard Joe's heavy footsteps rushing in a quick speed and opened her 
eyes. She saw a downside view of his face and quickly felt enraptured by
 his prominent features... his thick jawline, his straight nose... and 
even his adam apple. She had always noticed that he was blessed with 
good looks but it astounded her that in her current state of agony, she 
was faltering toward the attraction he exuded.</p><p> </p><p>"What are you doing here?" Ariel fished out her voice to ask. "Oh... Staying after school for piano practice?"</p><p> </p><p>"You're bleeding and you're still talking?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 chuckled a little, but the little movement made her aware of the 
throbbing pain. "I'll be okay... It's just a bleeding nose..."</p><p> </p><p>"It looks pretty serious," Joe grumbled. "How could you be so stupid?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 wanted to roll her eyes. At a time like this, he still had the habit of
 making her feel insulted. "Look... It wasn't my fault that Jolin went 
out of her mind."</p><p> </p><p>Silence engulfed them in the next few 
seconds. Even though the distance between her locker's location and the 
nurse's office wasn't so far, Ariel felt like time had slowed down in 
her moment with Joe. Despite the injury on her nose, Ariel felt very 
safe in his arms and wished that she could snuggle in their sanctuary 
for as long as she wanted.</p><p> </p><p>"Slow down, would you?" Ariel mumbled.</p><p> </p><p>"Why?"</p><p> </p><p>"I want to stay in your arms a little longer."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel had already closed her eyes; therefore, she missed the emerging shocked expression on Joe's face.</p><p> </p><p>"Stupid," Joe mumbled back. "You'll lose more blood."</p><p> </p><p>"I don't care..." Ariel said. "I won't die..."</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 didn't know what to say, still taken back by what she was telling him. 
However, he quickly shoved aside all thoughts, knowing that Ariel was 
just in a stir.</p><p> </p><p>"You know... I ended up this way is all because of you," Ariel continued.</p><p> </p><p>"Me?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. Jolin was jealous of me of being your girlfriend, so she attacked me."</p><p> </p><p>"You could have fought back. I thought you're supposed to be pretty violent."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel stifled a giggle. "Yeah, I am. But I'm only one body. Can't take three..."</p><p> </p><p>Joe's eye widened a little. "They all attacked you?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah."</p><p> </p><p>"You're not mad at me?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel shook her head lightly.  "Since you came to my rescue, I'll consider it even."</p><p> </p><p>There was a moment of silence. All that was audible was Joe's footsteps and their rapid breathing.</p><p> </p><p>"Sorry," Joe whispered.</p><p> </p><p>But Ariel had already passed out.</p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>When
 Ariel woke up, her mind was a blur. She gazed around, baffled at the 
recognition that this wasn't her bedroom. What happened? Her mind 
wandered. It took her awhile, but she finally remembered the fight with 
Jolin and how Joe came to her rescue.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh my god!"</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly,
 she felt someone tugging on her arm. She only realized that it was 
Rainie and Gillian when she looked up. But from her position, it was 
awkwardly straining her eyes so the girls helped her up.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm not dead yet?" Ariel asked, still in a daze.</p><p> </p><p>"You're
 lucky, Ariel. Thank God you're okay. Well, except for a minor detail," 
Gillian said, trying to divert her gaze away. Confusion crept up to 
Ariel's face at Gillian's sudden avoidance.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie tsked. 
The suspense was getting Ariel nervous like heck. "Don't worry. I know 
quite a few people who could introduce me to a few plastic surgeons--"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 gasped, horrified. She suddenly remembered Jolin had broken her nose 
with one mere slam against the lockers and damn it if it didn't hurt. 
She could even feel the pain crawling on her nerves that instant upon 
recollecting the event. "Oh my god!" Ariel shrieked, hands flying 
towards her nose. Upon the contact, she flinched.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie giggled. "Watch it, you. If you do that again, you will really need the best surgeon in the world."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 finally caught on with the joke when she saw Gillian trying hard to 
stifle a giggle. Frowning, Ariel crossed her arms, inclined to show her 
displeasure. "What friends I have! Fancy teasing me when I have a broken
 nose!"</p><p> </p><p>"Please. You didn't even tell us that you were 
picked on. We could have backed you up!" Rainie copied Ariel's gesture 
and crossed her arms in a maddened manner.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh Princess, 
do you not know that I don't have a cell phone, or a walkie talkie for 
that matter? And where were you these past two days? I know Gillian is 
studying, so you couldn't be with her. Are you running away because I'm 
winning the challenge," Ariel asked, smiling with sparkling naughtiness.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie
 giggled, making Ariel alarmed. She hadn't heard that giggle in a long 
time. "Oh, Ariel. You don't know yet. She was planning to tell you today
 but who would have thought she'd do so in this occasion," Gillian 
commented from aside.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie only smiled more brightly. 
Ariel was already starting to have an idea. The brightness on her 
friend's face was so alike to that of the time when she first dated. 
"Let me guess, you found another target?"</p><p> </p><p>"Wei! Why do you make it sound as if I'm a predator?"</p><p> </p><p>"Are you not?"</p><p> </p><p>"Anyway,
 since I'm in a good mood, I won't put your comments in mind. Well, you 
know that new basketball player Ethan Ruan?" Rainie giggled. "He asked 
me out the other day."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh my god!" Ariel gasped. "And I'm the last to know?"</p><p> </p><p>"Sorry,
 I was just too caught up with him that I forgot to tell you. Gillian 
only knew just this morning." Rainie informed apologetically. "Anyway, 
now I don't have to be envious of you and Joe anymore, hehe."</p><p> </p><p>Rainie's
 comment made Ariel's stomach flip. That day when Joe had officially 
announced that they were boyfriend and girlfriend was vividly clear in 
her mind. Apparently, her friends seemed to have bought it completely. 
They assumed that he was just denying it times before due to discomfort 
in adapting so they had assured Ariel that they understood why he acted 
coldly towards her. Ariel was sort of glad her friends had a rich 
imagination for it saved her nights of thinking of what to tell them. 
Nevertheless, Ariel was still uncomfortable with the matter since she 
and Joe weren't really "dating".</p><p> </p><p>"Speaking of Joe, where is he?" Ariel asked.</p><p> </p><p>"Look at you. Just a few hours of blackout and you're already missing him!" Rainie remarked, smiling broadly.</p><p> </p><p>"What?" Ariel asked, on the defense to deny but remembering that she was indeed Joe's girlfriend, she stopped herself.</p><p> </p><p>"How does it feel to be in love?" Gillian asked. "I've always wondered."</p><p> </p><p>"It's
 time you get a boyfriend, geek!" Rainie teased, sticking her tongue 
out. "Let's see. You'd know when you have that heart beating moment when
 you're near him. You know, like thump, thump, thump, really fast." She 
giggled again. Love really made one glow.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel almost 
stopped breathing as she tried to look for the symptoms of love. She 
remembered that day when Joe took the initiative to act as her fake 
boyfriend in front of Mike and Hebe. That day, her heart had beaten in a
 foreign rhythm so strange to her. It was something she had never felt 
before, not even with Mike.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel gulped, horrified. No, it couldn't be. I'm just thinking too much.</p><p> </p><p>"Is that how it feels," Ariel murmured.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie gazed at her friend in disbelief. "Of course! You should know. Don't you feel that with Joe?"</p><p> </p><p>"Do I..." Ariel said vaguely.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly,
 the door opened and Joe appeared at the door with a bag of what 
appeared to be food. He seemed surprised to see Ariel's friends there, 
and possibly, even embarrassed that he was caught visiting Ariel, even 
though they were titled a couple.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh! Gillian! Didn't you
 say we have to go to the library to study?" Rainie suddenly perked up 
and asked. She didn't let the puzzled Gillian answered before she 
quickly pulled her towards the door. "Get well soon, Ariel!" She winked 
and like that, the two of them left like footless ghosts.</p><p> </p><p>"What
 the... it's not like I'm in a hospital ward," Ariel murmured, a bit 
irritated at Rainie's obvious attempt to leave the two together. When 
she turned to meet Joe's gaze, he immediately diverted his away, not 
forgetting to plaster on his famous annoyed look.</p><p> </p><p>"I 
thought you'd be hungry when you wake up so I got you some food," he 
stated dully before giving her the bag. Ariel took it gracefully, a bit 
shocked at his caring gesture.</p><p> </p><p>"So, how's your nose?" Joe asked.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 looked up at him, feeling her heart beating faster. She recalled 
Rainie's words and dread befell on her like a ton. No, it couldn't be! 
It must be the blow from the nose... Yes that must be it. Ariel 
successfully convinced herself that she was just having weird thoughts 
from the blow.</p><p> </p><p>Joe looked at her strangely. "Wei, I'm asking you a question."</p><p> </p><p>"Huh? Oh... It's fine, thanks."</p><p> </p><p>"If that's the case, then I'm going to go."</p><p> </p><p>"Huh?
 What? Wait!" Before Ariel could control her mouth, the words spilled 
out from her mouth. Joe turned around and chucked her a questioning 
look, waiting for her to say what she wanted. Nervousness wrecked her as
 Ariel racked her brain for something smart to say. "Shouldn't you 
accompany me home? After all, it is partly your fault that I ended up in
 this situation. Not to mention, you’re my boyfriend aren't you? What if
 people happened to pick up the cold vibes you're giving me?" Oh my god,
 stupid Ariel! She cursed at herself, not believing what incoherent 
rubbish she just said What are you doing?</p><p> </p><p>Joe blinked a couple of times while Ariel buried herself in utter embarrassment. "Ok."</p><p> </p><p>His response surprised her. It shocked her even further that he actually bought her garbage.</p><p> </p><p>He
 approached her and helped her up. His touch made her recall that moment
 when he carried her to the office, bringing a flush to her cheeks. 
Ariel didn't know why but she all of the sudden wanted to feign weak. 
Her only injury was her nose, but with him around, she had a safe 
feeling that she could just relax.</p><p> </p><p>Joe noticed that she wasn't putting on her shoes. "Wei, you didn't break your hands did you? Put your shoes on."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel snapped. "Oh."</p><p> </p><p>“Idiot. You’re tying your shoes together. You want to make yourself trip?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh…”</p><p> </p><p>"Hurry up. You've been in the office for hours. The nurse is probably getting annoyed."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh."</p><p> </p><p>Joe couldn't help but add more annoyance to his expression. "What is up with you? Did your brain break as well?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 looked up, knowing that he was insulting her again. "I am a patient! Be
 nice, will you?" She finally found the normalcy to spit her usual 
flames.</p><p> </p><p>The two strolled out of the office. Ariel was 
walking behind him when she realized how handsome he looked from the 
back view. His figure was a bit lanky and there was a slight hunch to 
his back, but they made him all the more appealing.</p><p> </p><p>Oh my god. Ariel!!!</p><p> </p><p>She
 shook her head. No, this was not happening. This was not! She must have
 been brain damaged by Jolin and her sidekicks. That must be it. But it 
was futile. Rainie's words kept replaying in her mind like a broken 
record.</p><p> </p><p>"You'd know when you have that heart beating moment when you're near him. You know, like thump, thump, thump, really fast."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 shook her head frantically. She must do something! She knew that she 
was going to fall for him at this rate. There must be a way to stop it.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, she had an idea.</p><p> </p><p>"Wei,
 Joe!" Ariel caught up with him. Joe glanced at her with a bored look as
 he tried to walk faster. "Hey, we're just pretending to go out right," 
she said.</p><p> </p><p>He rolled his eyes. "Obviously."</p><p> </p><p>She
 let his derogatory tone pass this time. "Well, don't you think we 
should create some kind of contract between us? To, you know, establish 
some grounds and rules about this? Because after this incident, I feel 
that my health is definitely endangered, and it's all your fault.”</p><p> </p><p>Joe stopped in his steps.</p><p> </p><p>She
 studied him. But he was indecipherable as per usual with his stoned 
expression. Ariel realized that she needed to be more convincing. "I 
mean... what if I broke my legs next time? Would you take care of me for
 the rest of your life?" She didn't give him a chance to answer when she
 cut in, "Exactly! So why don't we sit down and discuss our terms?"</p><p> </p><p>"It's
 a stupid idea," he commented, snobby. "Jolin won’t likely do anything 
funny again. What happened today was probably an accident. I know her; 
she wouldn’t have lost it if you didn’t provoke her. A contract would be
 useless."</p><p> </p><p>"Wei! Didn't you see what happened today?! As 
you said, it was an accident. Who knows what accident could happen in 
these two months and a half. After all, they’re unpredictable. Maybe 
I'll even die. Can you live with that guilt? Being your girlfriend is 
damn troublesome. Do you know that the entire school is probably in 
hatred at me for so-called dating you?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel knew she won him when that vexation multiplied by a hundred. "Fine. But do that later. I'm tired now."</p><p> </p><p>"No!"
 Ariel said almost instantly. She felt that she didn't quite trust 
herself to wait any longer. If she didn't do anything to stop her 
feelings now, she'd surely fall hard for him, especially after how 
caring he had acted towards her. Ariel hated to admit it, but it was 
true. "We have to do it now! What if right at this second I get run over
 by a car?"</p><p> </p><p>"What the hell? This is not insurance, miss. 
You getting run over a car wouldn't have a thing to do with me since 
Jolin wouldn't have summoned that."</p><p> </p><p>Truth seemed to be 
ringing in his words but her stubbornness disallowed her to surrender. 
"I don’t care. Let's just get it done and over with okay?” Without his 
permission, she grabbed him and situated themselves on the seats outside
 the nurse office, but not before she grabbed some papers and pens.</p><p> </p><p>"Okay,
 let's get this started," Ariel said, more than eager to. "Numero uno: 
Both parties must not fall in love with each other."</p><p> </p><p>Joe scoffed. "That's a given."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 ignored him. But inside, it sort of bothered her that he was so 
confident he wouldn't like her. She, on the other hand, had to do all of
 these stupid tricks to barricade her heart. Ariel continued to scribble
 on the paper against the wall. "Number two: Party B must not ask for 
any intimacy from Party A."</p><p> </p><p>"And who is Party A and Party B? Please specify," Joe said a bit sarcastically.</p><p> </p><p>"Obviously I'm party A!" Ariel spat. "Why would I ask for intimacy from you?"</p><p> </p><p>Joe rolled his eyes but he didn't bother to answer her childish remark. "Number three: Party B must never insult Party A."</p><p> </p><p>Joe's eyes flinched a bit. "That can't be helped. Party A is too brainless sometimes."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel glared at him, but only hmphed. "Number four: Party B must use all of his means to protect Party A."</p><p> </p><p>Surprisingly,
 Joe didn't argue. Ariel was quite taken aback, but then it made sense. 
Her situation today, after all, was partly his contribution. "If either 
party breached any terms on this contract, Party B must suffer all 
consequences from Party A."</p><p> </p><p>"Wei! Why does the contract 
favor you?" Joe snapped hotly. "Give me that." He snatched the papers 
from her but the moment his eyes took a glance he realized that she had 
just played a prank on him.</p><p> </p><p>"Look at your face," Ariel 
said, cackling in laughter like a mad witch. "You think I'm that unfair?
 Please. Miss Ariel Lin isn't unreasonable, darling." With a snatch 
equally rude, she grabbed the papers from him. "If either party breached
 any terms on this contract..."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel thought for a 
moment. She wanted to come up with something that would definitely 
assure that she'd behave by the terms but at the same time, something 
that would seem insignificant so Joe wouldn't suspect anything.</p><p> </p><p>"For
 Party A, she would lose the challenge with her friends and has to 
suffer humiliation in front of the whole school. For Party B, he’d have 
to kiss Party A passionately.”</p><p> </p><p>Joe's eyes widened with 
shock. He definitely did not see that one coming. "That is stupid. Who 
the hell wants to kiss an airhead like you?"</p><p> </p><p>"Exactly," Ariel pointed out.</p><p> </p><p>“Your
 mind is pretty rotten from that challenge, isn’t it?” Joe asked, almost
 in derision. “I’m pretty shocked that your consequence is so much more 
extreme than mine.”</p><p> </p><p>His tight scrutiny almost made Ariel 
jump. “It’s pretty obvious, isn’t it?” She said, thanking God that she 
wasn’t stuttering. “Apparently, I consider the challenge way much more 
important than me kissing you, so of course I have to use it so I don’t 
breach the terms. As for you, I can’t think of anything else. You hate 
me don’t you? So kissing me works the best.”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure
 it’s just that?” He asked her, raising his eyebrow. “Or is it… Maybe 
you’re not confident of yourself? Perhaps… you’re scared that you might 
fall for me so that’s why yours is to the extreme.” His grin was so 
mischievous Ariel wanted to slap it off. “Hmmm. Now that I’m thinking, 
maybe the whole point to this contract is to stop you from falling in 
love with me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Nonsense,” Ariel harshly spat, even though
 inside she was in total jitters. “I made this contract because my life 
is endangered from your existence in my life. I have to do some means to
 protect myself.”</p><p> </p><p>Joe slumped back into his chair, his 
cool expression crawling back. Ariel knew he was teasing her and thanked
 God that he didn’t figure it out with his smart ass.</p><p> </p><p>“And
 for any reason, if either party is physically hurt, the other party 
must take on all responsibilities including the medical fees.” Ariel 
couldn’t help but add on to the contract just for the sake of making her
 reason seem all the more true.</p><p> </p><p>Joe rolled his eyes but he didn't further any other complaint. "So is that all?"</p><p> </p><p>"Is there anything else you want to add?" Ariel asked.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm not going to degrade myself and do such a stupid thing," Joe remarked, causing displeasure to roll across Ariel’s face.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 frowned. Fine, be snobby. “I’m going to call this the Date and Dump 
Contract. On February 14th, when the bet ends, I will dump you.”</p><p> </p><p>“This
 contract is clearly only for you, isn’t it?” Joe asked, annoyed. They 
both signed it, one with willingness while one with complete irritation.</p><p> </p><p>“There, you got what you want. Stupid contract.” He couldn’t help but utter another insult before getting up and walking away.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel frowned, following suit. “Do you know how many times you’ve uttered that word stupid ever since I saw you today?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t count stupid things.”</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 snarled inside, bearing no intention to argue with him further. Let him
 say what he wants; at least I got what I need. "I'll give you a copy of
 this to keep tomorrow," she told him, only to receive a careless look 
from him. She made sure to not let the contract slip as they made their 
way down the stairs. Even when Joe gave her an incredulous look at the 
way she treasured the contract didn't make her cease her effort.</p><p> </p><p>Unknown to him, this contract was important to her.</p><p> <br>---------------------------------------------------</p><p>Hello
