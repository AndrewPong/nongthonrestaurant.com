<p class="tocn"></p><h4><!--Subtitle begin-->The Big (and not so Bogus) Bear<!--Subtitle end--></h4>
<!--Chapter begin-->
When Ariel woke up the next morning, she realized that Joe wasn't in the
 room. He must have gone out, she concluded, which meant that the door 
was no longer locked.<p> </p><p>Eagerly, Ariel jerked her sheets aside and flew to the door, successfully sliding it open on her first try.</p><p> </p><p>Her
 feet carried her into the common room where she saw her Grandpa as well
 as Mrs. Cheng, chattering happily. Joe was at the side, folding his 
arms and looking grim as always.</p><p> </p><p>"Good morning, Ariel!" Mrs. Cheng cheerfully greeted, smiling broadly.</p><p> </p><p>"Good morning," Ariel returned politely.</p><p> </p><p>"Did you have a good night sleep?" Her Grandfather asked.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 glanced toward Joe and mumbled something under her breath. But upon 
noticing the expectant look on the older man's face, she just nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“It
 appears that it would be very soon ‘til we become in-laws,” Mrs. Cheng 
whispered with a giggle. "That's great!" Mrs. Cheng beamed, sipping her 
tea. "Oh my... it's absolutely cold this morning. We won't be heading 
back until this afternoon. Do you two mind going out together to collect
 woods so that we can make a fire to keep warm until then?"</p><p> </p><p>"Me and him?" Surprise made Ariel gawk incredulously. "Umm..."</p><p> </p><p>"Is there a problem?"</p><p> </p><p>Yes,
 there was. Ariel still could not get over the fact that Joe 
continuously refused her request after she stooped that low to beg him 
to agree. Talk about hard-headed! "Well, I don't exactly want to--"</p><p> </p><p>Joe stood up from his seat. "We'll go."</p><p> </p><p>Grandfather Lin and Mrs. Cheng both looked pleasantly surprised. "Wonderful!" they both exclaimed exuberantly.</p><p> </p><p>Then Joe left the common room, signaling for Ariel to follow.</p><p> </p><p>Shock consumed her and made words impossible to utter. What the...?</p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------------------</p><p> </p><p>Ariel couldn't believe her luck.</p><p> </p><p>Out
 of all the bad things that could have happened to her, she had to be 
paired up with that unfeeling jerk for her task for the day. She was 
trailing behind him unwillingly as they proceeded down the pathway that 
would lead into the forest. God, Ariel dared not think of what might 
happen if she were to stand beside him. Perhaps the mere presence of his
 would drive her insane and make her spit out fireballs that would only 
ignite even more adversary. So she figured that the farther away she 
stayed from him, the better.</p><p> </p><p>However, his long legs were 
speeding too quickly for her shorter ones. Ariel was cursing in her mind
 at his insensitiveness. Couldn't he slow down a bit? Especially knowing
 that she was probably ten feet or so behind him?</p><p> </p><p>"Wei!" 
Unable to withstand being left behind, Ariel called after him as she 
dashed quicker. "Wait up!" She was running up to him with all her might.
 In no time, she was right beside him. As much as she disliked the idea 
of staying in close proximity with him, Ariel thought it was better than
 to be left behind like discarded garbage. She just didn't have to speak
 to him. How difficult could that be?</p><p> </p><p>A few minutes passed as they ventured further into the forest.</p><p> </p><p>"Don't go too far. We might get lost!" Ariel spoke up after awhile, the fear of such idea starting to get to her.</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 stopped in his footsteps. Although his back was to her, Ariel could 
already sense the look of frustration that might be wrinkling his face. 
But then again, he never showed emotions so openly. She quickly dumped 
the thought.</p><p> </p><p>He spun on his heels, pinning his eyes on her. "What, are you scared?"</p><p> </p><p>"N-no!"
 Ariel quickly rebuked. She already disliked the idea of him seeing 
through her fear. "I'm just saying... I mean, we have to get back in a 
short period of time. The farther we go away, the longer it'll take to 
get back. Why can't we just settle for these logs and twigs here?"</p><p> </p><p>"Can't
 you see? They're so scattered and few. I'm sure that there are plenty 
more up ahead. Come on, stop being such a wimp," Joe said.</p><p> </p><p>"Wimp!?"
 Two large widened eyes stared back at him piercingly. "Would you stop 
with the insults? I have a name to be called if you haven't noticed."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, I've noticed," Joe told her in a low tone. "But then again, such a pretty name doesn't suit your face or your personality."</p><p> </p><p>Oh,
 the nerve of that guy! Ariel hissed madly inside her mind. He just 
could never act civil toward her, could he? "If you dislike me sooooo 
much, why did agree to let me come with you? If you said something, your
 mother wouldn't force us together. But no, you decide that it will be 
fun torturing the both of us with your stupidity and first class 
arrogance!"</p><p> </p><p>His reply threw her off, however, for it was something she would never expected him to say. "It's better than going alone."</p><p> </p><p>For
 a moment, Ariel was stumped by surprise, her voice lost. Wait.. did he 
just say what she thought he said? "Oh..." Her sudden angst and fiery 
mouth suddenly couldn't pump out anything insulting to say.</p><p> </p><p>Then
 he adapted a smirk. "But then, if I were given another choice, I would 
much be glad to pick a dog to help, than someone as incapable as you. A 
dog can at least obey my orders and not yap nonsense at my ears as 
though it's the only thing she can do."</p><p> </p><p>"You--" Ariel, 
obviously deeply humiliated, lowered her eyebrows and her intense amber 
eyes boiled with loathing. "You are so getting it!" Impulsively, she 
threw a hard fist at him, but her baffled state of mind had stirred her 
aim as she missed his face by a couple of inches.</p><p> </p><p>He 
caught her wrist before she could launch another attempt. His grip was 
hard and relentless. "Listen, stop acting so childish. We have things to
 accomplish and you throwing fists aren't going to get us anywhere."</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah,
 I'm so childish, and you, what, soooo mature??!" Ariel snapped, drawing
 her hand back as she pulled away from his captivity. "If it weren't 
because of you calling me names so childishly, we wouldn't be arguing!"</p><p> </p><p>"Should
 I say sorry then?" Joe offered, yet her sensitive ears could not 
dismiss the sarcasm behind his words. "Is that what it takes to pacify a
 baby like you? Okay, then. Sorry."</p><p> </p><p>"I don't need empty apologies!" Ariel announced heatedly. "God! I'm sick of you. Don't ever, ever talk to me again!"</p><p> </p><p>Then without so much as another word, she stomped ahead of him, mumbling incoherent curses under her breath.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey, you're going off in the wrong direction," Joe said from behind her.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel rolled her eyes. "What, is there just only one way to find stupid logs?" God, he was so stupid.</p><p> </p><p>"Okay, then. Don't blame me when you get lost."</p><p> </p><p>"Hah!
 I don't need your help. I can do this on my own!" She yelled, as her 
feet continued carrying her forward. "You think you're so great? Well, 
think again!"</p><p> </p><p>"I'm just being nice here. If you insist to act so stupidly, then be my guest."</p><p> </p><p>"I said; don't ever, *ever* talk to me again!" She shouted one last time.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 was so mad; she couldn't even think right anymore. How could such an 
insufferable man like him ever exist in her life? The moment they laid 
eyes on each other, they couldn't even have at least one decent 
conversation. If there was anything that annoyed her beyond words, he 
would be the only candidate to take the cake. Or was it *pie*?</p><p> </p><p>"Arg, stupid clichés!" she mumbled.</p><p> </p><p>She
 was walking further and further away from him until she heard no more 
of his annoying, condemning voice. Good, she thought bitterly. I hope 
you'll get eaten up by a bear!</p><p> </p><p>Remembering her assigned 
task, Ariel quickly opened the sack and began collecting some logs and 
twigs she found on the way. They were indeed scattered, and it took her 
ten minutes to only have gathered around ten or so logs.</p><p> </p><p>"Maybe
 I should have taken his advice..." Ariel found herself mumbling but was
 quickly against it. "No! It's better this way because I don't have to 
see his stupid face!"</p><p> </p><p>Another fifteen or so minutes passed
 by. Ariel had collected a commendable amount of logs and she smiled 
with satisfaction. What was he talking about? There were plenty of woods
 everywhere!</p><p> </p><p>When she had gathered so many logs that she 
almost couldn't carry the sack, Ariel decided that it was time to head 
back to the temple. Her good mood was clearly shown as she smiled 
chirpily, patting herself on the back for a job well done. She couldn't 
wait to see that shocked look on Joe's face. Perhaps she even managed to
 collect more than he did!</p><p> </p><p>Eager to return, Ariel hastened
 her pace as she proceeded further down the pathway. Yet, the more she 
walked, the farther it seemed. Before she knew it, orange rays were 
emitting from the sky, indicating an impending sunset. Had she been 
walking for that long? Ariel's mind was so exhausted, she couldn't even 
care anymore.</p><p> </p><p>'Just go straight...' Ariel thought. 'I don't remember making any turns...'</p><p> </p><p>And so, she continued. And continued.</p><p> </p><p>And continued.</p><p> </p><p>"Wait
 a second," Ariel said to herself as she stopped, realization suddenly 
hitting her. "I've seen that tree before... And that one too!" She could
 tell because they were different from the rest of the pine trees. The 
leaves were already beginning to darken to a color of yellowish brown, 
indicating a beginning to a change of season.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes 
curved as she reflected. Oh, God... She should have known that this was 
inevitable. Ariel knew she was bad with directions. She shouldn't have 
been so stubborn. But it was all Joe's fault! He got her so flustered 
that she was determined to show him what she was made of. If it hadn't 
been for his non-cooperating attitude, she wouldn't have dashed off so 
rashly.</p><p> </p><p>"Stop thinking about him. What use would it be to 
think of his face? It'll only frustrate me more," Ariel thought, trying 
to keep optimistic about the situation. "Okay. Maybe if I just follow 
this trail, it'll bring me closer to the temple."</p><p> </p><p>And with a hardened resolve, Ariel ventured down the path, not knowing that lay ahead...</p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p> </p><p>Time
 was running against her. She had been walking for several hours 
availingly without spotting an escape route. Feet sore and mind in 
anxiety, Ariel was growing fearful by the second. It didn't seem likely 
that she would find the path back home any time soon.</p><p> </p><p>Her 
mind ran for some curses. It was all that Joe's fault. If he hadn't 
pricked her, she wouldn't have been so angry to take off on her own. 
Trying to settle her frustrated heart, Ariel decided to take a rest.</p><p> </p><p>But
 then, she began to hear sounds. Immediately, fear crawled up her face, 
freezing her. Don't be scared, Ariel, she told herself. You're tough, 
remember?</p><p> </p><p>Futile. No matter how tough she appeared, inside
 she was still a girl with fears of her own. Since little, she hated the
 small noises lurking in quietude. It felt as though something was 
creeping up behind her and she detested the feeling of ambiguity.</p><p> </p><p>Crap,
 it must be a bear. She thought. Preparing herself, she clenched her 
fists, feeling the bear coming closer from behind her. When she sensed 
the bear was close enough, she whipped around, throwing her fist and 
slamming it into her attacker's snout.</p><p> </p><p>Or rather, nose.</p><p> </p><p>"Crap!" The person's hands flew to his injured spot.</p><p> </p><p>"It's you!" Ariel recognized Joe.</p><p> </p><p>Joe's eyes gleamed with disbelief. "Who did you think it was? A bear?" He was trying hard not to show too much pain.</p><p> </p><p>Unease settled on Ariel.</p><p> </p><p>"How
 ridiculous can you get?" Joe icily asked, knowing at once that she did 
indeed thought he was a bear. He sat down on a log. If he was pissed 
off, she couldn't see it much. He said it in such a cold tone that it 
almost appeared he had no emotions.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel sat down beside him. "Does it hurt?" she asked, feeling blameworthy.</p><p> </p><p>"You think I'm made of iron?" he murmured.</p><p> </p><p>She bit her lips, guilt sluicing her body whole. She didn't mean to attack him. "Why were you sneaking up on me?" she asked.</p><p> </p><p>"Sneaking? I was walking. Maybe you're just insecure."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel's
 fists clenched, infuriation simmering in her blood. "You don't forget 
to insult people even when you're hurt, huh?" She didn't bother to hide 
her offended tone. "Seriously, don't you ever consider others' 
feelings?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel realized she had shown too much feeling 
and diverted her gaze in embarrassment. She could feel his glare on her,
 and regretted ever showing her wounded pride.</p><p> </p><p>"I thought 
you said I'm of no importance? If so, why do you care about what I 
said?" Joe asked. She wasn't looking at him, so she didn't know what 
expression he had, but from the tone, she knew he was mocking her.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel turned to face him. "Wei! Who said I care?! I'm just telling you that you're such a jackass!"</p><p> </p><p>"Seems like I'm not the only one who throws insults. Don't be a hypocrite."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 flushed, realizing that he was right. But god damn it, she would not 
let him the pleasure of triumph over her. That was the least she could 
do to save herself from further mortification. "You know what? I'm 
leaving. And don't dream of tagging along with me," she said, 
majestically determined.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm not the one with the brain full of rocks. Not my loss," his voice made her stop in her steps.</p><p> </p><p>That
 was the last hit to her tolerance. Every one of his word was like an 
acid arrow, shooting towards her way one after another. Ariel was used 
to being picked on, but how in the world did his words hurt her so much?
 It wasn't like they were friends or even acquaintances so why did she 
even bother with him? Anger ascended its way to her chest, but she chose
 to ignore him. That was right. If she didn't rebuke, he would not have 
the chance to hurt her further.</p><p> </p><p>"You're not really taking off on your own, again, are you?" He asked, granting her one more chance to change her mind.</p><p> </p><p>Keep walking, Ariel. Keep your head high.</p><p> </p><p>"Remember
 what happened just some hours ago? I admire you, Ariel Lin Yi Chen. 
You're such an idiot. How could someone be so stupid?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 tripped over a log. But the pain accumulating in her ankle was in no 
comparison to the exasperation thundering at its zenith. She felt so mad
 that all of her patience had diminished into dust. She grabbed some 
grass and pulled them out, screaming and venting out her emotions.</p><p> </p><p>God,
 she hated it. Ever since she met him, how much smaller did her 
self-esteem get? He never once failed to insult her at any given 
situation. Did he even know how harsh his words were? Each comment, 
every little insult stung so badly, leaving swollen blisters that'd take
 ample time to heal.</p><p> </p><p>Joe walked towards her, slightly worried. "Wei... are you okay?"</p><p> </p><p>She
 turned her head away, breathing rapidly. There was so much that she 
wanted to say, but she didn't know where to start. It hurt so much to 
bottle up all of her feelings. Perhaps, she had been bottling too much 
that she finally snapped.</p><p> </p><p>"Why is it that I'm here in the 
first place? Why is it that I'm so willing to suffer all of the 
injustice and your stupid comments? Yes, I was dumped by my boyfriend! 
Heck, I was fucking cheated. But so what?! Does that mean I'm not worthy
 to respect? And why did I have to meet him that day? Maybe if I didn't,
 I wouldn't be chasing after you, discarding my pride and dignity! You 
think I'm happy about begging you to be my boyfriend? You think I want 
to be your girlfriend? If it weren't because of… I wouldn't even think 
about getting close to you!"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel could feel the hot tears building up behind her eyes, but years of being picked on had built her tough.</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 knelt down beside her, grabbing her ankle. Ariel seemed startled. 
"How's your ankle?" he asked, observing it. Ariel suddenly felt foolish 
for saying so much to someone she barely knew. What would he think of 
her now? Only God knows.</p><p> </p><p>"It's swollen," he said. When he 
looked up, he caught her staring at him. Ariel immediately glanced away,
 humiliated. He smirked. "Come on, I'll carry you back home."</p><p> </p><p>He
 didn't even give her a chance to refute when he turned around and gave 
her the mount onto his back. Ariel resisted at first, but he was 
persistent. In the end, he was walking down an unfamiliar path with her 
on his back.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel studied his face from the side, biting 
her lips. He didn't know that at the moment, he seemed so handsome to 
her. No one had ever dealt her with such caring and gentle side besides 
her grandfather and mother. She had always yearned for a caring father 
but she would have never imaged the frosty biting Joe to fulfill her 
childish wish.</p><p> </p><p>"So how come you don't have a girlfriend?" Ariel asked, suddenly interested.</p><p> </p><p>"I have better things to do."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel scoffed. "Yeah, right. Like studying?"</p><p> </p><p>She
 could feel his taunting. "Yeah. Not everyone is free like you. 
Bad-tempered, too, throwing fists even at someone walking behind you."</p><p> </p><p>A
 frown plastered itself on Ariel as she responded with slight 
indignation. "So what if I'm bad tempered? At least I'm not incredibly 
rude." She felt affronted, but she let it go this time, knowing that he 
didn't mean it personally. "Okay... Then another question. Why don't you
 have that many friends? Everybody likes you. Did something happen?"</p><p> </p><p>"Nothing
 happened," he said, confusing Ariel with his pointless answer. "I was 
basically that kid in the corner, unnoticed and nonexistent. I didn't 
talk to anybody. Even the teachers got annoyed with my autistic 
behavior."</p><p> </p><p>"Hmm... You don't seem at all autistic to me," 
Ariel commented. Sure, he was cold but it never occurred to her that he 
was anti-social.</p><p> </p><p>She could feel his scoff again, but he 
didn't respond to her remark. "But there was always this one girl who 
tried to talk to me, while the world ignored me. She was a nice girl. 
But destiny is really unpredictable. Just when I actually felt accepted,
 my mom decided to send me to a new school, thinking that I can start 
anew. It's pretty funny. She didn't want to send me to a therapist, but 
instead, sent me to new and strange place. She didn’t even know what she
 was doing."</p><p> </p><p>"Hey... don't say that. Your mom cares about 
you," Ariel cajoled him. "Like me. My mom thinks I have studying 
problems. She would always force me to do my homework. I know she's only
 doing what's best for me."</p><p> </p><p>"If she meant good for you, she wouldn't force you to do things you didn't want to," he said bitterly.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 frowned at his insult aimed at her mother. "Don't accuse my mom. You 
don't even know her." But when gazing at him, she knew he meant his own.
 "Why don't you talk to her?" she asked, feeling a bit sympathetic.</p><p> </p><p>"She doesn’t understand. Hell, she doesn’t even listen. What's the point wasting my breath?"</p><p> </p><p>She
 suddenly felt sad for him. What does it feel like, being unable to 
communicate with your mom? Since little, she was extremely close with 
her mom--almost in a best-friend way, and they would always share every 
single thing with each other. There was absolutely no secret between 
them. She understood and cherished this intimate relationship. When she 
thought about it, there was nothing in the world she would trade this 
relationship for. No way.</p><p> </p><p>But to think that someone had 
never had a relationship like that before... How could it be? How could 
one be so distant with one own parents? Ariel tightened her arms around 
Joe, having a strange urge and desire to provide him warmth. Poor Joe, 
she thought, he must be very lonely.</p><p> </p><p>"Wei, what do you think you're doing?" Joe questioned, snapping her from her reverie. "Are you trying to choke me?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 loosened her grasp, uttering a sorry. She thought about the 'girl' Joe 
mentioned and undeniably, she felt a tad bit jealous. But in another 
aspect, she was also just like the girl. Ariel won't deny that she was 
attracted to him the second they met. It was just that he was so harsh 
in his words that such attraction was suppressed. Now that she grasped 
another side of him, Ariel acquired a compelling inclination to find out
 more.</p><p> </p><p>"Joe..." she said softly.</p><p> </p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p> </p><p>"I'm
 going to be your friend okay?" She said, resting her head on his 
shoulder. "I'll protect you when others bully you. I'll give you a hug 
when you feel lonely. I'll talk to you when no one does. Hao bu hao? 
(Okay?)"</p><p> </p><p>"Bullshit,” he said. “Stop doing useless things.”</p><p> </p><p>She
 didn't expect such a harsh answer. "I'm not smart, but I'm a good 
friend. You can trust me. I don't give my friendship so easily, though. 
So you should feel honored." Ariel observed his expression, but he 
didn't seem at all affected. "Joe, my friend. I am going to prove to you
 my true sincerity. I'll make you believe in friendship." She never felt
 so determined, positive, and even confident.</p><p> </p><p>"Who do you think you are?" Joe's voice rose. "I hate it when people talk to me as though they can change and control me."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel gazed at him in astound. Was he getting mad? She wasn't sure about what she said was wrong. "I--"</p><p> </p><p>"Just be quiet." He said with a solemn tone that was hard to see why it was so. "I don't want a dog barking at my ears."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 frowned with displeasure. He never forgets to insult, did he? Ariel 
cursed at him inside her head. He was one stubborn mule. What was so 
hard about accepting her as a friend? She saw it more of a benefit than a
 harm, so why was he so overly guarded of himself?</p><p> </p><p>"I'm not a bitch," she growled.</p><p> </p><p>"Might as well be."</p><p> </p><p>"If I'm one, you must be the male version."</p><p> </p><p>"There's no such thing."</p><p> </p><p>Even
 though, Joe had rejected her as a friend, Ariel still held onto the 
hope that he would one day be. She could discern from his eyes that he 
wasn't that cold as he made himself appeared. Maybe it was still a bit 
early; he hasn't gotten used to her yet.</p><p> </p><p>There was 
something about him that was so mysterious and so attractive to Ariel's 
eyes. She knew that there was more to him that what he let on and she 
was determined to fish him out of the pool of iciness. But like a fish 
out of water, it would not like its new suffocating surroundings and
