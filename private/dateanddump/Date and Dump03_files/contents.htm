</p><p class="tocn"></p><h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="tocn"></p><h4><!--Subtitle begin-->Jerk Alert. Hit or Run?<!--Subtitle end--></h4>
<!--Chapter begin-->
Ariel was snapped out of her daze to the sounds of muffled voices in the
 distance. Her eyes curved in scrutiny as she tried to assimilate what 
looked like an arguing scene. What concerned her was that her 
grandfather was the one involved. Her instincts swayed her feet to rush 
toward the direction of her house.<p>As she reached closer, Ariel 
realized that it was just a false alarm because she discerned no 
maliciousness on either of their faces. Gripping onto her backpack 
strap, she eyed the two talking adults suspiciously, her mind surging 
through the possibilities.</p><p>The woman looked around forty or so, 
old enough to be her mother but too young to be a candidate for her 
single Grandfather. She knew her Grandfather was a perky old man, who 
always harbored a few sneaky motives up his sleeves. Although old, his 
heart was absolutely more livelier and tender than a teenage girl like 
herself.</p><p>"Gramps?" Ariel decided to speak up, putting a stop to 
their conversation as she inched closer. Her eyes were sparkling in 
question, wondering who the woman was. Judging from her clothes, she 
looked like a decent woman, perhaps a little more than average. The 
gleaming peal necklace didn't go unnoticed by Ariel.</p><p>"Ariel, my 
child!" Grandpa Lin greeted with his usual cheerfulness, beaming at his 
granddaughter with adoration. "Guess who's here?"</p><p>He was referring
 to the woman, she knew, but Ariel could not trace her identity. She was
 sure she had never seen this woman in her entire life. But she 
admitted, the woman's face was familiar in an unusual way.</p><p>"Who's her?" Ariel bluntly asked, getting a bit freaked out by the woman's intense gaze on her.</p><p>The woman was giggling to herself. "My, Grandpa. She is a jewel."</p><p>Grandfather laughed out heartily. "Anyway, Ariel, this is our neighbor, remember?"</p><p>Neighbor? Oh no, please don't let it be...</p><p>"Mrs.
 Cheng," Grandfather Lin filled in as Ariel's eyes bulged out 
incredulously. Right, Ariel thought. Yet, it made no sense that for the 
past ten or so years, their neighbors had never had the decency to come 
and drop by for a visit. Why do so now? She couldn't understand.</p><p>"Oh, well, hi Mrs. Cheng," Ariel greeted politely. "You must be Joe's mother, right?"</p><p>The woman's eyes were laughing. "Yes. How did you know?"</p><p>She
 knew a lot actually. Ariel was very aware that Joe had been her 
neighbor, just never really cared that much about him until recently 
when her friends presented the challenge of dating him. Ever since she 
met him backstage, Ariel’s negative opinion of him hardened. The fact 
that he held a reputation of the school’s school prince didn't justify 
his crude attitude toward her. Ariel had bore a grudge against him since
 then.</p><p>"We're classmates," Ariel said, then quickly swapped the topic. "To what honor do we owe your visit?" she asked politely.</p><p>Grandpa
 Lin chuckled. "Oh, it's a funny story. When I went outside to water the
 garden, I accidentally aimed the hose at Mrs. Cheng. There you see, I 
felt so guilty for my clumsiness. I decided to invite Mrs. Cheng and her
 son over to dinner as an apology. It's such a shame that we've been 
neighbors for years, yet we never get to know each other!"</p><p>At 
this, Ariel's eyes widened in dread, looking highly alarmed. After their
 first encounter, she didn't expect to see him again so soon. Fate sure 
had a way with executing its mischief.</p><p>"Oh, okay. You two go ahead
 and continue. I'm heading to my room now," Ariel quickly excused 
herself as her nerves began to tense uncontrollably.</p><p>Ariel was 
heading straight upstairs, mumbling words under her breath when her 
clumsy self knocked bull's eyes right into his manly chest that was 
face-level to her. She looked up at a towering Joe standing at about 
over six feet tall. The bad thing about tall guys was that... they're 
just so *tall*.</p><p>"Oops. I didn't mean to..." Ariel trailed off, 
realizing her high squeaky voice. God damn it. He sure looked 
intimidating enough to have that impact on her. Ariel cursed inside her 
mind silently.</p><p>Ariel shook her head, attempting to brush past him but the limited space made the task more difficult than she bargained for.</p><p>"Are you a freaking statue or what?" Ariel asked irritably. "Don't you see I'm trying to pass through?"</p><p>"Hostile, aren't you?" Joe asked.</p><p>"Toward a particular type of people, yes," Ariel said, patience waning.</p><p>"What kind of people, specifically?"</p><p>"Snobby
 people like you, obviously!" Ariel snapped harshly. She eyed him 
tensely, wondering what was up with his initiative behavior. Wasn't he 
known for brushing people off coldly and ruthlessly? Why was he speaking
 to her all of a sudden? After a short moment of silence, Ariel peered 
up at him. "I know you're here for dinner. Just don't grate on my 
patience because I won't want to beat up my guest."</p><p>With that, she
 crammed through and left into her room. Ariel dropped her bag on the 
bed and peeled off her sweater. She decided to surf the internet first 
before returning downstairs for dinner.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, there was a knock on the door.</p><p>"What?" Ariel murmured, momentarily forgetting about dinner. "I'm busy. Leave me alone."</p><p>"You call playing games as being busy?"</p><p>Ariel's
 body was threatening to freeze at the sound of the voice. Immediately, 
she swiveled her chair around to meet Joe's frosty eyes. "What are you 
doing here?"</p><p>"Your grandpa asked me to come up here to notify you 
of dinner. But apparently, you're too 'busy'." He purposely emphasized 
the last word.</p><p>"Yes I am!" Ariel rebutted fiercely, not liking the way he seemed so daunting. "So leave me alone!"</p><p>Joe
 invited himself into her room, throwing a glance all over the place. 
"This is your room?" The heaps of garbage on the floor didn't go 
unnoticed by his sharp observational skills. "Nice."</p><p>Instantly, 
Ariel tossed a murderous look to Joe. "What's with *you*?" She asked 
grudgingly. "I thought that you wouldn't give people like me a speck of 
your attention."</p><p>His eyes were studying her in apprehension. "Are you still mad because I rejected you?" he bluntly asked.</p><p>Ariel's
 blood pressure suddenly shot up by notches. Apparently, this guy didn't
 get it when she specifically said she didn't care about him. "I told 
you. I didn't ask you out, so technically, you didn't reject me." She 
crossed her arms. "Beside, why would I get mad over a jerk like you?"</p><p>"You
 know, you are very judgmental," Joe said. "We're neighbors, yes, but we
 don't even know each other. Don't you think that calling me a jerk is a
 bit far-fetched? Especially when we only talked at school once?"</p><p>"Oh, are you hurt?" Ariel sardonically asked.</p><p>"Hardly," he said.</p><p>"Then
 why should you care?" She threw the question. Ariel was certain that 
she didn't like this guy already. Ever since their first encounter, he 
acted like he was a superior being toward her. She couldn't believe that
 she agreed to go out with him for the sake of a deal. Ariel's eyes 
suddenly shot open when the remembrance of the deal hit her like a 
hurling rock.</p><p>For a moment, she had nearly forgotten about such 
thing. Seeing Joe now reminded her of her task in pursuing him. But how 
could she? She hardly knew about him! And they were barely on friendly 
terms. What had she done? Regret simmered inside her and she had often 
scolded herself for the last twenty-four hours. However, there was no 
use moping about it, for what was done had already been done. She could 
only barge forward courageously now.</p><p>She sighed silently. God, 
what a torture, but undeniably it was her fault. Who asked her to agree 
to the deal? Who rashly thought that by agreeing with the deal that she 
could easily move on and forget about her ex? To put it shortly, Ariel 
knew she deserved the headache she had now.</p><p>Fine, it's just 
dating, she thought. It can't possibly be *that* hard. Beside, Ariel's 
pride wouldn't let her be a wimp and leave behind something she promised
 to accomplish. Running away wasn't just her style.</p><p>Ariel adapted a fake smile, her eyes piercingly sweet. "So... Joe. Do you have a girlfriend?"</p><p>Joe
 stared strangely at her, wondering what was up with her change of 
attitude. Concealing his curiosity, he scoffed at her. "I don't like 
answering stupid questions."</p><p>"Okay fine. What type of girls do you like?"</p><p>"Is there a difference from the previous question?"</p><p>Ariel rolled her eyes detestably. "Just answer me, damn it!"</p><p>"I
 like someone who isn't always asking stupid psyche questions and 
doesn't pry into the personal business of someone she just met," Joe 
said, sneering at her.</p><p>"You--" Ariel had to chuck in a whole lot 
of effort to suppress the urge to knock him out unconscious. Upon 
remembering her task however, Ariel bore an indifferent front. "Okay, 
whatever. I just want to you to do want thing."</p><p>He quirked an eyebrow. "I don't like the sound of this."</p><p>"Be my boyfriend," Ariel spat.</p><p>He looked irritably at her. "No."</p><p>"Why?" She asked curiously. Ariel was careful not to take his rejection too personally. This is all a game... she thought.</p><p>Joe
 was studying her with a careful eye. The smirk on his face never 
vanished once. "Well, then. Tell me a reason why I should date someone 
like you."</p><p>Ariel smiled confidently. "For one, I am a very highly 
sought girl in school. You don't know how many people are lining up just
 to grab a chance with me." Okay, that was bluffing but who cares right?
 Pride wouldn't allow her to go without a praise or two about herself. 
"Secondly, you should be honored that a girl like myself had just asked 
you on a date... I mean, come on! You can't be that blind, can you?!"</p><p>He
 didn't answer her, for he was too occupied looking her from head to 
toe. Ariel suddenly felted intruded by his gawking eyes. Instinctually, 
she flew her arms across her chest in a protective manner, lest he was 
some kind of wild lion.</p><p>Joe laughed. "Okay... So you're saying that a bonehead with average looks like you deserve my attention?"</p><p>"Wait, what? Average?!" Ariel shot outrageously. "You think you're so great yourself?!"</p><p>His
 face suddenly turned stern. "Look, I don't know what the hell your 
motive is, but if you think you can manipulate me into dating, you're 
flattering yourself."</p><p>Ariel fumed. How did she ever ended up 
associating with stupid jerks like him?! "For your information, you're 
the *one* that's flattering yourself! You... you... aren't even that 
great! Beside the fact that you're a giant tower, and and you're good at
 sports... and and... you're pretty smart... You don't have anything 
else! Nothing! Absolutely nothing!"</p><p>The smirk on his face grew more and more visible. Ariel didn't know what she was doing wrong.</p><p>"Nothing?" Joe repeated.</p><p>"Okay,"
 she said softly, imagining a big fan flapping at her face as her temper
 subdued. "Are you sure you don't want to date me?" She repeated, 
feigning a sweet look.</p><p>"I don't date boneheads."</p><p>"You are pushing the last button, my dear cold *prince*," Ariel gritted in an overly sweet tone.</p><p>"Sorry," he said sarcastically.</p><p>He
 just didn't know how to stop, did he? But then again, he was merely 
trying to anger her. The more she was frustrated, the happier he was. 
Ariel would not allow him to have the satisfaction of playing around 
with her emotions like that.</p><p>She cleared her throat strongly, and 
said, "Listen, hell must turn lose if I *ever* like a jerk like you. 
Don't even consider it possible. I don't like you one single bit. 
However, I am more than willing to date you," she said.</p><p>His 
eyebrows were raised this time. The oddity of the contradiction in her 
words propelled him to ask of her motive. "Is there something behind 
this?"</p><p>Oh, no. Did she make it that obvious? "Uh, no! Of course not! It's just... well yeah, I want to date you."</p><p>“Reason being?"</p><p>"Because... Because you're the school's magnet! Everyone wants to date you, right? So do I!"</p><p>The
 shift of her eyes to the doorway served as a hint that she wasn't 
telling the entire truth. The careful Joe would not fall easily into 
whatever trap the girl was trying to catch him in. But he had to admit, 
he was a bit curious to find out what she was up to. Just a moment ago, 
she was treating him with a fierce hostility accompanied by a bad 
temper. How could she just instantly change her behavior toward him and 
now act as though she adored him so? There was just something behind it 
all; he knew that much.</p><p>"Dinner's ready," Joe announced. "Come on. Don't leave them waiting."</p><p>Ariel gawked surprisingly. "You haven't answered me yet--"</p><p>"What's
 taking the kids so long?" The voice of her grandpa penetrated into her 
consciousness as Ariel looked toward the doorway. Grandpa Lin and Joe's 
mother were observing the both of them with an interest clearly ebbed in
 their eyes.</p><p>A giggle escaped from Joe's mother as she sent him a 
look. "Why, Joe... In my whole life, I had never seen you're into a girl
 that much..."</p><p>Grandpa's Lin eyes lit up in fascination. He 
quickly trode to Ariel, expecting her to provide him with something as 
equally pleasant. "Ariel... Is that true? Oh my! You are growing up 
fast. But I'm not complaining! The sooner you find yourself a suitor, 
the better. I can finally rest at peace--"</p><p>"What are you talking about, Gramps?" Ariel shot madly. Disbelief had consumed her entirely. "I'm only seventeen!"</p><p>"Didn't
 we hear they were talking about a date or something?" Joe's mother 
quipped in, delighted. She observed Ariel, nodding in some kind of 
approval. "She's not bad..."</p><p>"Mom, don't talk nonsense," Joe interrupted. "There's nothing between us."</p><p>"Ah! Don't lie! You've never noticed the women around you. But just now, you made an exception to finally acknowledge a girl..."</p><p>Joe rolled his eyes. "It's nothing of that sort. We were just exchanging a civil conversation. Right, Ariel?"</p><p>His
 mother ignored him, however. She turned two colorful eyes at Grandpa 
Lin. "Say... didn't you mention you own a temple of some sort? Perhaps I
 could make a trip there and pray for some blessings."</p><p>"Good idea!" Grandpa Lin agreed enthusiastically. "We shall set a date where we can all go there together!"</p><p>"Mm hmm!"</p><p>With that, the both adults turned around and began walking off, engaged in a delightful chatter about the upcoming event.</p><p>Two
 young adults were left in awkwardness as they watched their elders 
sauntering off in ridiculous talk. They were refusing to look at the 
other's in the eye.</p><p>Wait a minute.. Ariel thought deeply. This 
just gave her another opportunity to get close to Joe. Or she could even
 consider this success, because technically it was a "date". Who cared 
if family members tagged along? Rainie hadn't specified the amount of 
people classifiable as a "date". Ariel smirked with triumph. Perhaps 
this wouldn't be that bad at all...</p><p>Mission accomplished? You bet!</p><p>On the other hand, she heard Joe mumbling... "A family date with her? I'd rather go to hell..."</p><p>Frowning, Ariel looked away. You think I want to do this? She thought. I have my own difficulty too! Hmph.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------</p><p>Nhu
 was supposed to post this but since she's busy, here I am. Will Joe go 
on that family date with Ariel? Stay tuned to find out!! :)</p><p>Also 
this chapter is a huge dedication to the awesome Ying and my mui mui 
Terrena who despite not being Arjoe fans went through the pain of 
reading our story. So touched *tears slip* I love you guys!!! *Nhu 
saying "me too!" in the background* So here it goes, a big dedication to
 the both of you!!</p><p>And off I go searching for food!</p><p>~Bunny Ears ^_~
