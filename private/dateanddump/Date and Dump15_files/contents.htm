</p><p class="tocn"></p><h3>Chapter 15</h3>
<p class="tocn"></p><h4><!--Subtitle begin-->Another Side Of You<!--Subtitle end--></h4>
<!--Chapter begin-->
"Students, may I have your attention," Mr. Lee beckoned as he stood tall
 with his balding head. Beside him, there was a girl with a bright smile
 standing. Ariel could not believe her eyes. "Today, we have a new 
student joining our class. She just transferred from Xing De. New 
student, would you like to introduce yourself."<p> </p><p>The whole 
class looked at the new student with impressed faces. For sure they knew
 Xing De was a prominent elite school that only the rich could afford 
attending. It was more than fascinating to have a transferred student 
from there attending such a regular school in the district.</p><p> </p><p>The
 girl beamed enthusiastically with strong sagacity of style. "Hi 
classmates! My name is Selina Ren. I know it will be a great year for 
us!"</p><p> </p><p>Lots of boys whistled while the girls glared with 
envy. The girl was beautiful like a goddess and sweet like an angel. Her
 friendly tone had already won her numerous admirers.  She was probably 
going to be a Hebe #2. The only difference was that she appeared a lot 
smarter. Ariel could only stare at her</p><p> </p><p>Selina waved to her
 classmates as she stalked down the aisle for an empty seat. Out of all 
the seats she could have chosen, she opted for the one closest to Joe.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 watched them; Joe's eyes gleamed with brightness as he welcomed her in 
his subtle ways. Apparently, he seemed as though he had already known 
it. Ariel felt disgusted at herself when she felt envy nibbling at her. 
For the past week, she hadn't seen Joe much and she didn't bother to 
look for him either.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie poked Ariel in the side. "Wei,
 who is she?" The girl glanced at the duo in the back with tight 
observation, popping potato chips in her mouth. "I don't like her 
already."</p><p> </p><p>"Rainie, you barely know her," Gillian pointed out.</p><p> </p><p>"So
 what? She should know Joe is already taken. What is wrong with her? 
Ariel, you better do something before she snatches your boyfriend away,"
 Rainie said warily.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel sighed, grabbing some chips from Rainie's bag of chips. "They know each other."</p><p> </p><p>"WHAT?!?!" Both Gillian and Rainie blared like horns, eyes completely widened.</p><p> </p><p>Mr. Lee turned his head. "Is there something the matter?"</p><p> </p><p>"No, Mr. Lee. You must have heard something from your head," Rainie said.</p><p> </p><p>"Is that so?" Mr. Lee's eyebrows perked up in skepticism.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes.
 Isn't that right, classmates?" Rainie glanced around, threatening all 
the students with her fiery eyes. They all responded yes to the teacher.
 Rainie was known as the alligator of the school, ready to bite your 
heads off if you don't waver to her commands. "See? Mr. Lee, maybe it's 
time for you to see a doctor."</p><p> </p><p>"Ms. Yang, are you eating in my class?"</p><p> </p><p>Rainie quickly hid her chips in her desk. "Ah, it must be your hallucination this time."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 was trying her hardest to stifle her laughter from aside. Trust her 
friend to know how to make her laugh. Ariel felt so glad to have Rainie 
as a friend.</p><p> </p><p>Mr. Lee turned his head around and Rainie 
instantly pulled her bag of chips out again, throwing several pieces in 
her mouth. "You're not serious, are you? How could the cold prince KNOW a
 girl? He usually pays them no attention!"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel scribbled in her notebook. "How am I supposed to know?"</p><p> </p><p>"Something is fishy," Rainie scrutinized. "Look at them talking. How could the Joe who is always so quiet talk in class?"</p><p> </p><p>"I'd probably say she must be someone he likes from before," Gillian deduced.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel's eyes perked as she shot her friend an amazed gaze. "H-how would you know?"</p><p> </p><p>"Obviously,
 look at them. They're chatting as though they had known each other 
forever. Would you chat with a stranger like that? When the cold prince 
talks to a girl like that, there is obviously something between them. I 
don't think he even uses that kind of face when he talks to you," 
Gillian said.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel was quaked in unease. Gillian was right. Joe had never acted in such a demeanor when he was with her.</p><p> </p><p>"How did you know they knew each other, Ariel?" Rainie suddenly asked.</p><p> </p><p>"I've seen them together before..." Ariel murmured.</p><p> </p><p>"WHAT?! WHEN!?"</p><p> </p><p>Mr. Lee turned back around once again. "Ms. Yang, Ms. Chung. I'm sure this is probably in my head again?" He asked, sarcastic.</p><p> </p><p>"Stupid
 Mr. Lee. Two hours of detention? He must be joking me," Rainie cursed 
madly when the three were in the detention room later that day</p><p> </p><p>"I
 have never gotten detention before! This is surely going to leave a 
stain on my perfect record!" Gillian exclaimed with horror.</p><p> </p><p>"You
 guys shouldn't have opened your big mouths," Ariel said. "Even I got 
dragged down with you two. Mr. Lee isn't dumb as he appears to be."</p><p> </p><p>"That old man. He's an imp."</p><p> </p><p>"With a bald head," added Ariel.</p><p> </p><p>"And stubby arms and legs," said Gillian.</p><p> </p><p>"He probably eats children for breakfast."</p><p> </p><p>The three girls looked at each other and giggled.</p><p> </p><p>"Okay,
 I think we should devise up a plan," Rainie suggested, making the other
 two look at her with strange eyes. "I mean, about Ariel and Joe. 
Seriously, Ariel, you're not planning to sit back and let your boyfriend
 does whatever he wants, are you?"</p><p> </p><p>"What is your plan?" 
Ariel asked, interested. Although knowing that it was wrong, she 
couldn't help but let curiosity devour her rationality. She, too, wanted
 to know what it was all about.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie smirked smugly.</p><p> </p><p>-----------------------------------------------------</p><p> </p><p>"Are you sure this is going to be fine?" Ariel asked a bit skeptically. "Do we have to wear these masks?"</p><p> </p><p>"Of
 course we do. You want her to know who we are?" Rainie hissed as she 
fixed her hair. Clad in exaggerated janitors' outfits, the three looked 
outrageously into their roles. "No one will recognize us for sure."</p><p> </p><p>"Really?
 Isn't it a bit too extreme? It might catch unnecessary attention," 
Ariel said, referring to their heavy aprons, head scarves, rubber boots 
and gloves, and three sets of mops and other things. They looked like 
spokespersons for cleaning supplies in a super market or advertisement.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm
 more afraid of Mr. Lee catching us here," Gillian commented. "The 
detention monitor would surely find it odd we've been to the bathroom 
for so long."</p><p> </p><p>"Hush! Here she comes," Rainie hushed. 
"Remember, once she turns around this corner, we snatch her and threaten
 her to spill everything!"</p><p> </p><p>Indeed, there was Selina Ren, 
coming out of the school's auditorium with Joe by her side. The sight of
 them with full chemistry and smiles made Ariel's skin crawl with goose 
bumps and discomfort. For sure she didn't like the scene she was seeing.</p><p> </p><p>"Damn it, why is that Joe with her!?" Rainie hissed.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 could no longer fix her eyes on the duo. The sight had gotten her 
stomach churning to a point she could no longer stand it. "Forget it, 
let's just go."</p><p> </p><p>"What?! No! I used up all of my saliva to sneak us out here, no way--"</p><p> </p><p>"Well,
 well, well, look what we got here." Suddenly, a familiar voice snapped 
the girls' attentions. The voice was so damn recognizable that Ariel 
didn't need a second to pinpoint who its owner was.</p><p> </p><p>"Mike 
He!" Rainie exclaimed with utter disgust, forgetting that she was in 
disguise. "How dare you show up! Didn't Ariel make it clear to you?"</p><p> </p><p>Mike's
 smirk was the epitome of all arrogance. "As I expected. Of course, in 
this school, who else but our three musketeers would do such a stupid 
thing like disguising as some janitors?"</p><p> </p><p>"Why you!" Rainie hissed, jerking up her mop and ready to whack him with it but Mike stepped back in awareness.</p><p> </p><p>"Whoa,
 don't do anything rash and life threatening here. I have witnesses." 
With a snap of his fingers, a group of wild-looking rebels appeared from
 the corner. Clad in leather and heavy shoes, they resembled a bunch of 
thugs belonged in gangs.</p><p> </p><p>"What do you want?" Ariel finally
 found her voice to bawl. She stepped in front of Rainie and glared up 
at Mike with intense resentment. Nothing in the world could describe the
 revulsion she bore for this human being.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh Ariel," Mike said in a sweet but mocking tone. "Have you forgotten what you did to me?"</p><p> </p><p>"You're such an insignificant thing to me that I don't have a frigging idea of what I did to you." Ariel spat with obduracy.</p><p> </p><p>There
 was an offended spark in his eyes but it disappeared the second it 
emerged. "You've gotten feistier, babe," he said, touching her mask. She
 stumbled backwards and slapped his hand away. "No wonder Joe didn’t 
really fall for you.”</p><p> </p><p>“For your information, they are really going out!” Rainie snapped. “They’re in LOVE!”</p><p> </p><p>“Didn’t you say it was fake--”</p><p> </p><p>“Hahaha! I was never aware that Mike, the girl’s so-called heartthrob, was a turtle!” Rainie looked belittlingly at him.</p><p> </p><p>Mike’s
 eyes flashed. “I don’t give a damn if they’re really going out or not.”
 He turned to Ariel. “Remember I said you’re going to regret what you 
did to me Ariel?” He smiled mischievously before snapping his fingers 
and summoning his men.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie, Gillian, and Ariel stumbled backwards as the gang advanced on them.</p><p> </p><p>"Wei!
 What do you think you're doing! This is school ground! You'll get 
caught for whatever you plan to do!" Rainie blared, nervousness eating 
her up. Those muscles on the guys looked even bigger than her head.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, you're right." Mike said, with a smirk.</p><p> </p><p>Before
 they knew it, they were being bagged in sacks and carried elsewhere. 
The sun immediately blinded them when they were released from the 
suffocating sacks.</p><p> </p><p>"What the hell do you want, spit it 
out, bastard." Ariel tore off her mask and glared at Mike, hating that 
smug look on his arrogant face. From the sight, she knew they were on 
the rooftop of the school, the area most desolated and high up in the 
air by four stories.</p><p> </p><p>Mike didn't answer, but only signaled
 his followers to take action. Like a group of wolves, the pack 
approached the three girls with sinister grins and itchy hands.</p><p> </p><p>"Don't you dare do anything funny!" Rainie screamed, grabbing onto Ariel.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, look, she's screaming!" One of the men laughed.</p><p> </p><p>"She's pretty cute. Let me tell you, I want that one."</p><p> </p><p>"Wei! There's only three of them and so many of us. You gotta share!"</p><p> </p><p>"Bull shit! None of you will touch me!" Rainie cried. "I'll fucking bite your hands off."</p><p> </p><p>"Ooo, she's feisty."</p><p> </p><p>"Stay away from her!" Ariel hissed. "Touch her and I’ll kill you!"</p><p> </p><p>By
 now, all of the men's attentions were paid to the barking Ariel and 
Rainie, who were all stubborn to submit defeat. Gillian found this as an
 opportunity to run and look for help. Surely, they would not be able to
 fight this on their own.</p><p> </p><p>The guys grabbed onto Ariel and 
Rainie. The sudden touches triggered strong reactions from the girls as 
fright hammered them to desperation. But the guys were enjoying and 
laughing at their unwilling actions which were making the fun escalating
 even more. From aside, Mike watched with merciless amusement, loving 
the entertainment he was seeing.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel caught his 
shameless amusement and repulsion thundered down her nerves. She 
couldn't believe what an animal Mike was. If these wolves were monsters,
 Mike was definitely something beyond that. Ariel could no longer bear 
the harassment as she harshly bit into someone's hands.</p><p> </p><p>"AH!" He cried, slapping Ariel tight across the face. "How dare you!"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel's eyes gleamed with infuriation and mulishness. "Biting you is even more disgusting that your nasty face," she spat.</p><p> </p><p>"Why
 you--!" The man pulled her up by the collar of her shirt, bringing her 
face near to his. The exasperation suddenly ceased when he realized how 
flawless and smooth her skin seemed. Like an instant morph, his 
expression changed into that of a lascivious beast. "Ah, look at you, so
 pretty." With a smirk, he threw her against the rail, making her 
release a painful yelp.</p><p> </p><p>Mike instantly became alert.</p><p> </p><p>The
 man rubbed his hands in a perverted manner, licking his lips. He 
approached closer to Ariel, and she rammed against doom as fear finally 
found its demonstration in her face. "Don't blame me. You made me," he 
said, grabbing her clothes. She let out a cry, struggling, but it wasn't
 long before he was jerked back and got punched across the face.</p><p> </p><p>"Fucking bastard," Mike spat, throwing the man to the ground. "I didn't say you can have her!"</p><p> </p><p>The man wiped the blood of his face. "What are you talking about Mike? You said we can have fun--"</p><p> </p><p>"Fucking shut up!" He blasted the man in the abdomen, sending him flying against the rail.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 shrieked at the blood flowing out of his lips and cuts. The man glared 
at Mike with hatred before turning around to Ariel and pulled her up, 
groping her shoulders. "I'm having fun alright. What are you going to do
 about it?"</p><p> </p><p>"You son of a bitch," Mike cursed, trouncing on the man. He gave a blast to the man's face.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 watched with utter bafflement. She didn't know why Mike had lost it all
 of the sudden but she was somewhat grateful for his help.</p><p> </p><p>"You'd
 better leave now before I lose my fucking patience," Mike growled, 
glaring penetratingly at the bruised person in his grip. Immediately, 
the man waved his hands and ushered his followers to leave.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel glared at Mike, whose expression she could not decipher.</p><p> </p><p>"Just leave."</p><p> </p><p>"Don't think I'm going to be fooled by that! Are you putting up a show for me?" Ariel could not help but doubt his help.</p><p> </p><p>"Think what you want--"</p><p> </p><p>PA!</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 slapped him. "I can't believe you'd stoop this low! You jerk!" She 
spat. "I don't want to see you ever again!" With a face red of 
resentment, Ariel was about to stomp off when Mike grabbed her wrists.</p><p> </p><p>"Ariel--"</p><p> </p><p>"Let me go!"</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly,
 Mike was pulled backwards by a force. Ariel let out a scream when she 
witnessed someone blasting him across the face. That person was 
shockingly Joe.</p><p> </p><p>"You bastard," Joe cursed, giving him another punch.</p><p> </p><p>Mike
 slammed against the steel walls, blood dripping out of his mouth. 
Ariel's hands made their way towards her mouth as she watched with 
terror and uncertainty.</p><p> </p><p>"If it isn't Joe Cheng, the cold 
prince," Mike said with a smirk. "You're a bit late. It was a pack of 
us, and we had a lot of fun--"</p><p> </p><p>Joe grabbed Mike by the 
collar and delivered another fist to his face. Mike didn't stand to be a
 punching bag so he struck back, snapping Joe's head to the side. Ariel 
let out a horrified scream.</p><p> </p><p>"Stop!" Ariel cried, running up towards them.</p><p> </p><p>"Get
 away, Ariel!" Joe said, pushing her to the side. It was rare that he 
said her name but Ariel was too terrified to heed to his command. The 
two were still punching the daylights out of each other when Ariel 
decided to interfere, stopping the blow that Mike was about to send 
towards Joe. However, his force was far too strong for Ariel to stop it.
 Instead, it sent her backwards, and she was tumbling over the rail with
 a scream.</p><p> </p><p>"Ariel!" Rainie cried, petrified.</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 acted on instincts and immediately flew over the rail and grabbed on 
the edges of Ariel’s rubber gloves right in the nick of time. "Hurry! 
Give me your other hand!" He hissed, seeing the rubber was about to rip 
apart.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel was too shocked at first, but she instantly 
recovered. She reached out her other hand and he instantly grabbed it 
with force. But from his expression, she knew he was having a hard time 
keeping her up. He was already halfway bending over. If this was to 
continue, she was afraid that she might pull him down with her. It 
wasn’t high enough to kill, but she could break several bones.</p><p> </p><p>"Joe, let go. You're going to fall," Ariel cried.</p><p> </p><p>"Idiot! Just hang in there," he rebuked, and then turning to the people standing behind him. "Wei! Give me a hand!"</p><p> </p><p>The
 shocked Rainie and Mike instantly flew to his aid. Selina, Gillian, and
 even Jolin who had followed them here could only watch from the side, 
stoned and hoping that Ariel would be safe.</p><p> </p><p>Luckily, the three managed to pull Ariel back up. Gillian immediately fled to Ariel, making sure she was okay.</p><p> </p><p>"You
 stupid bastard!" Rainie hissed at Mike, delivering him a tight slap 
across his already bruised and wounded face. "Look at what you did!"</p><p> </p><p>Mike rubbed his sore cheek, avoiding Rainie's hot glare.  "I can't believe you're so low! You almost killed her, fucking jerk!"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel slowed down her breathing and waved at Rainie. "Rainie just let it go--"</p><p> </p><p>"No!
 I gotta teach this bastard! He needs to learn how to respect us women! I
 can't believe you'd hire a bunch of thugs to rape us! You low life dog!
 I don’t know what Hebe sees in you! She must be blind like Ariel has 
once been!"</p><p> </p><p>Joe's resentful gaze lingered on Mike. 
Rainie's words made his inside snap as he grabbed Mike by the collar and
 glared into his eyes, resembling a raging demon. "You're lucky Ariel's 
fine. If anything had happened to her, I'd make sure you won't ever see 
the daylight again. Now leave!"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel met Mike's gaze and 
she immediately turned her head away. Although he had tried to save her,
 she could not forgive him for what he had done, even though he hadn't 
meant for things to turn out this way. Mike left the scene seeing that 
he was not welcomed.</p><p> </p><p>Selina rushed to Joe. "Are you alright?" She asked worriedly.</p><p> </p><p>Joe nodded, but he could only focus on Ariel. "Are you okay?"</p><p> </p><p>She absentmindedly nodded.</p><p> </p><p>"Come
 on, I'll bring you home," Joe said supporting her. With that, he led 
her towards the exit, leaving Rainie, Gillian, Selina, and Jolin to look
 after them.</p><p> </p><p>Selina could not understand what their 
relationship was; her gaze was a burning curiosity to know. Jolin could 
only watch with jealousy and rage, while both Rainie and Gillian were 
exchanging smiles and knowing glances.</p><p> </p><p>"Damn, that girl is lucky," Rainie said.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 looked up at Joe as he walked downstairs. He had a firm grip on her arm
 that brought her a secure feeling to her heart. They were so close she 
felt his genuine protection. Unknowingly, a smile was shining bright on 
her face.</p><p> </p><p>"Thanks..." Ariel murmured.</p><p> </p><p>He 
glanced at her, his bored expression crawling back on his face again. 
"What? If it was somebody else, I would have done the same thing. It's a
 human life, after all."</p><p> </p><p>"I'm talking about right now," Ariel pointed out. "Thanks for accompanying me home."</p><p> </p><p>"Stupid.
 We're neighbors. It makes perfect sense. I just don't want your mother 
and grandfather to blame me if something happens to you," Joe quickly 
explained, uptight.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel frowned, disappointment sinking 
in. She was hoping that his dislike for her had somewhat defused, but it
 seemed that his feelings were still unchanged. He was still that aloof 
person who gave her the cold shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>"Ow..." Ariel mumbled, finally realizing the pain in her wrist.</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 turned to look at her, noticing the bruise on her wrist. The gloves by 
now were already torn, reminding him of how Ariel was on the borderline 
of death. All of the sudden he felt a tinge of relief and gladness 
bursting in his chest seeing Ariel by his side. "You're such a baby," 
Joe said.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel bit her lips. "You grabbed me so hard..."</p><p> </p><p>"Does
 it really hurt?" Joe asked uncertainly, feeling slightly guilty. When 
Ariel didn't respond, he stopped her and pulled her down to sit on the 
steps. "Let me see."</p><p> </p><p>He studied her wrist. He felt 
blameworthy upon seeing the imprint of his fingers. “Why are you so 
heavy? If you were lighter none of it would have happened.”</p><p> </p><p>She frowned at his remark. “What… I don’t weigh that much…”</p><p> </p><p>Joe smirked. “Try telling that to the judge.”</p><p> </p><p>“Look,
 you have some bruises on your face too…” Ariel took notice, hands 
instinctively flew to stroke them. “Aiyo, do they hurt?”</p><p> </p><p>He was taken aback by her sudden touch. “These are peanuts to me,” he murmured.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah!”
 Ariel snapped her fingers, remembering. "I think I spotted an ointment 
in the pockets of the apron earlier," she said, digging through it. She 
found it and gleamed in happiness. "I knew I could count on those old 
ladies to carry these things around!"</p><p> </p><p>Joe rolled his eyes.
 "Why are you dressed this way, anyway?" He asked, snatching the 
ointment from her hand. Shock immediately shot through her as she 
realized he was going to apply the ointment on her.</p><p> </p><p>"I-I..." Her mind was nowhere near normality when he gently massaged her wrist.</p><p> </p><p>"Don't
 you girls have anything better to do? Always coming up with these 
stupid gimmicks. You were trying to sneak out of detention weren't you?"
 Joe asked.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel was paying no attention to him as she 
watched him massage her. The softness in his eyes and tender movements 
threatened to make her heart soften its walls. She had never seen such a
 compassionate side of him.</p><p> </p><p>"This going to hurt a bit..." he said, as he pressed on her bruise, making Ariel jump in pain, “just hang on..."</p><p> </p><p>The
 pain didn't matter at all, really. As long as she could watch his 
gentle face she wouldn't mind suffering any sort of affliction. As he 
continued his delicate massage, Ariel caught herself admiring his long 
tall nose, his eyes, his tender lips, and prominent chin. My god, how 
could someone look so handsome? He was not a least bit aware of how 
deadly attractive he now seemed to her.</p><p> </p><p>'Joe... Although 
he is only a fake boyfriend, I just feel that our closeness right now 
isn't that far off from a normal couple. You treating me with such care 
and consideration... how can I stop myself from falling in love with 
you?'</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------</p><p>Mike
 has reappeared once again! It's not the last time you'll see of him
