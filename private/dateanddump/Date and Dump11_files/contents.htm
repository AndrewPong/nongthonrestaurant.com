</p><p class="tocn"></p><h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<p class="tocn"></p><h4><!--Subtitle begin-->"Merry Christmas... friend"<!--Subtitle end--></h4>
<!--Chapter begin-->
It was December 25th. Ariel could not remember when was the last time Christmas had felt so... crowded.<p> </p><p>From
 every corner of her house filled with guests. There were some that she 
knew, some that she invited, and some she barely recognized. She didn't 
miss those glaring looks from numerous girls either. Didn't some of them
 go to her school? Ariel did not remember inviting them but she figured 
after the announcement that she and Joe were dating, they were all 
furious. Maybe they were planning to murder her tonight.</p><p> </p><p>"Ariel!"
 Rainie and Gillian appeared from the packed sardines. "I can't believe 
it. Since when did you become so popular?" Rainie asked, amazed at the 
number of people. "It's like... my god!"</p><p> </p><p>Gillian nodded in
 agreement. "You've been very hot lately, Ariel. A few days ago before 
school ended, you were the topic of every conversation."</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah,
 hot. Every girl in school practically hates me now," Ariel said with a 
tinge of sarcasm. "After the Jolin showdown, I am seriously not in any 
mood for more fan attacks."</p><p> </p><p>"Dating Joe is like dating a celebrity, isn't it?" Rainie giggled. "Gosh, I'm envious."</p><p> </p><p>"Wanna switch places?" Ariel asked.</p><p> </p><p>"Actually, no. I still want to live."</p><p> </p><p>Grandfather
 Lin and Rilla appeared out of nowhere, staring at Ariel with amazed 
looks on their faces. "Ariel, dear. I never knew you had so many 
friends!" Grandfather Lin exclaimed.</p><p> </p><p>"I am so proud of my daughter!" Rilla beamed.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel weakly smiled. Friends? Hah. They all want to kill me...</p><p> </p><p>
 "Say, Ariel... Where is your boyfriend?" Rilla asked, shooting her 
knowing looks. Ariel had told her the whole thing with Joe, and despite 
it being all a facade, the woman was still very curious and interested 
to meet this alleged Cold Prince of the school.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel had 
invited him of course. At first, she was against the idea since he was 
not the type who liked these kinds of things, but knowing that it would 
arouse suspicions, especially from her friends, she reluctantly did so. 
But whether he was coming or not, she was uncertain.</p><p> </p><p>That uncertainty instantly cleared away when she caught sight of Mrs. Cheng.</p><p> </p><p>"Grandfather
 Lin!" Mrs. Cheng exclaimed, approaching the group when a bored and 
stiffened Joe at her trails. He didn't look like he wanted to be there.</p><p> </p><p>"Why,
 Mrs. Cheng," the old man replied, gleaming with excitement. "I was 
anticipating your presence! And of course, Ariel's boyfriend." He stroke
 his beard, nodding at Joe who politely nodded back in acknowledgement, 
even though he seemed to be detesting the title.</p><p> </p><p>"What?!" 
Mrs. Cheng immediately opened her eyes in surprise. "Joe and Ariel are 
going out?!" She turned to her son, asking for a confirmation but he 
only looked away with obvious discomfort. Ariel could see he wasn't 
about to admit to anything.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes, yes, we are," Ariel said with a smile.</p><p> </p><p>"My
 God! I knew it!" Mrs. Cheng exclaimed. "Ever since that temple date, I 
have been waiting for this day to come! What I didn't expect is for it 
to happen so soon!!" She was laughing now, glowing with exuberance. 
Ariel immediately stiffened.</p><p> </p><p>"Let's leave the children 
alone, shall we?" Rilla suggested. The adults agreed and decided to 
leave. Rilla decided to chuck Joe a wink before she left, which 
completely baffled him.</p><p> </p><p>Once they left, Rainie immediately
 stepped up to Joe and Ariel. Ariel gulped, ready for the girl's attack.
 "You guys went on a DATE?" She asked, eyeing them harshly. "Why, you 
never told me!!!! Do you even take me as a friend?"</p><p> </p><p>Joe 
glanced at Ariel, grasping that she had not told them about their date. 
He expected her to have spilled it long ago, but now, he was quite 
surprised to find out she didn't.</p><p> </p><p>"Naughty, naughty, naughty!" Rainie exclaimed. "So you two have already fallen for each other after a few days?!?!"</p><p> </p><p>"Uhhh...." Ariel stuttered. "Maybe?"</p><p> </p><p>"Oh my god!" Rainie shook her head. "This challenge was obviously so easy for you!!"</p><p> </p><p>"It's not over yet," Gillian reminded.</p><p> </p><p>"I
 have absolutely no hope," Rainie sighed pessimistically. "I can't 
believe the cold prince could fall for a girl like Ariel so easily!"</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 looked like he wanted to strangle Rainie. "Umm..." Ariel said. "Hey, 
where's your new boyfriend, Rainie? I want to meet him!"</p><p> </p><p>"He's busy--hey, don't try to change the subject!" Rainie hissed. "Shouldn't you guys... you know, exchange gifts?"</p><p> </p><p>"Gifts?"
 Ariel asked, bewildered. She had not thought about getting Joe 
anything, and likewise, Joe didn't either. "Uh, later ok?"</p><p> </p><p>"What? Don't tell me you guys didn't get anything!" Rainie looked surprised. "What kind of couple are you?"</p><p> </p><p>"A couple who doesn't need to give each other gifts," Ariel nodded.</p><p> </p><p>"Bullshit!"
 Rainie shot back. "Which couple doesn't do that? You know... Now that I
 think about it... You two don't really look like you're going out... 
For God's sake, you don't even hang with each other at school much..." 
The suspicion was multiplying and Ariel witnessed it very clearly in 
Rainie's scrutinizing eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"What are you talking about?" 
Ariel snapped. "Stop trying to be a reporter and dissecting our 
relationship okay? We are very much in love, for your information!" To 
demonstrate her point, she grabbed onto Joe's arm. He looked completely 
annoyed and uncomfortable. "Right, Joe?"</p><p> </p><p>Joe looked down at her. Her eyes were demanding him to play along. Only then did he reluctantly nod.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh
 really?" Rainie asked. "Okay! Why don't you two hug in front of that 
Christmas tree so I can take pictures for you?" She offered with a sweet
 tone and wide smiles. "We should make some memories for you two, 
shouldn't we?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel wasn't sure, but was this some sort of test? "Pictures?? Uh... Joe doesn't like pictures!"</p><p> </p><p>"Why?" Rainie was persistent.</p><p> </p><p>"Because...
 because he looks like crap on pictures," Ariel popped up a lame reason.
 Joe tossed her an outraged look, growing more annoyed by the second. 
"Yup, that's right. You don't know, Rainie, but he looks terrible and I 
mean terrible on camera."</p><p> </p><p>"I'm leaving," Joe decided that 
he wasn't going to stay and listen to the girls' boring chat anymore. 
Rainie and Gillain instantly chucked him odd looks. Sure he was snobby, 
but shouldn't he accompany his girlfriend? The notion only rattled on 
Rainie's suspicion even more.</p><p> </p><p>"You two are not really going out, huh?" Rainie glared at Ariel. "You two are faking it. I just know it."</p><p> </p><p>"W-what?
 What are you talking about?" Ariel pretended to look shocked. Rainie 
did not have the chance to retort before a swarm of girls made their way
 towards Ariel. Apparently, these girls were taking advantage of Joe's 
disappearance.</p><p> </p><p>"Ariel Lin," one of the girl said with 
utter disgust rolling out of her mouth. "I can't believe Joe is going 
out with this ugly girl."</p><p> </p><p>"For real! Look at her! No boobs at all!"</p><p> </p><p>"Wei!" Ariel snapped. "Who are you to criticize me like that?"</p><p> </p><p>"Seriously. Take a look at yourself, bitches. You aren't any better!" Rainie snapped.</p><p> </p><p>"Bitch, what did you just say?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, slut. I dare you to say that again."</p><p> </p><p>All
 of them looked like they were about to pounce on Rainie and Ariel. 
"What? Are you scared?" And the girls roared into hyena laughter.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel and Rainie exchanged glances before simultaneously shrilling together, "You're all ugly! U-G-L-Y!!!!!"</p><p> </p><p>"Why you fucking bitches--"</p><p> </p><p>"Run!" Gillian hissed.</p><p> </p><p>Like
 three dogs fleeing danger, the girls picked up their feet and made a 
dash down the hallway, knocking into several guests. The pack of hyenas 
were trailing at their heels, spitting out names and demanding them to 
stop. Some of them even attempted to throw their heels. One slammed into
 a middle aged man's head and he was yelling the crap out of the 
culprit.</p><p> </p><p>"Damn it! I never heard of running away and 
hiding in my own house!!" Ariel spat, lifting her dress to ease her 
running. The mob was still cursing like mad behind them. "I sure as hell
 am not inclined to get beaten up like a pulp again!"</p><p> </p><p>"That stupid bunch of hyenas! Why the hell did you invite them?!" Rainie blared.</p><p> </p><p>"I didn't!!"</p><p> </p><p>"This isn't working! We gotta split up and distract them!" Gillian said.</p><p> </p><p>Exchanging
 looks, the girls nodded and went their separate ways. Rainie decided to
 run upstairs, while Gillian fled into dining room. Ariel scammed into 
backyard where emptiness and loneliness lingered since no one wanted to 
be out in the coldness. Ariel didn't either. She was shivering like 
crazy and was about to return to the house when she caught sight of Joe 
sitting against the tree.</p><p> </p><p>Curious, Ariel approached him. When he saw her, his expression immediately turned glum.</p><p> </p><p>"Aren't you cold?" Ariel asked.</p><p> </p><p>"Why are you here? Shouldn't you entertain your guests?" Joe asked.</p><p> </p><p>"And
 get myself killed?" She said aloud, before taking a seat beside him. 
The wind was harsh and her hair was flapping all over the place. "I'm 
going to be killed out here too..." she murmured.</p><p> </p><p>Joe smirked. "If you can't bear it out here, then don't force yourself."</p><p> </p><p>"Wei,
 who said I can't?!" Ariel hissed back. "Stop looking down on people, 
sheesh." But her actions completely betrayed her words as her arms found
 their way to wrapping around her.</p><p> </p><p>"Stop being so stubborn," he replied, noticing her shivering. "You don't have a jacket on. Better go back in."</p><p> </p><p>"Stop
 telling me what to do!" She snapped. She hadn't meant to sound so hot 
headed; it must be the coldness that was getting into her. "You can 
always lend me your jacket you know..."</p><p> </p><p>Before she knew 
it, she felt his sweater tossed over her shoulders. Ariel was completely
 taken aback at his action. Sure it was exactly what she said, but she 
hadn't exactly meant it.</p><p> </p><p>"Just keep it. I'm not that cold," he said, as if reading her thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh..."
 Almost immediately, she felt guilty for snapping at him earlier. "Um...
 thank you." But was he serious? She was freezing to death! How could he
 not be cold? Ariel couldn't bear to let him suffer. "Actually, never 
mind. It's your jacket..." She shoved it towards him, but he pushed it 
back.</p><p> </p><p>"You wanted me to lend my jacket. I did! Now you're giving it back to me. Are you an idiot or what?" Joe said vexingly.</p><p> </p><p>"I..." Ariel was stammering. "But it's so cold out here-"</p><p> </p><p>"Then go back in!"</p><p> </p><p>"But I want to accompany--"</p><p> </p><p>"Nobody is asking you to."</p><p> </p><p>"But-"</p><p> </p><p>"Okay,
 that's enough. Stop bothering me will you?" It was clear Joe's patience
 had totally vanished. "I'm getting sick of seeing you, with your 
friends continuously pestering me and all. I'm tired of having girls 
coming up to me and asking me why I'm dating a girl like you. Ever since
 I met you, life has turned around for the worse. The last thing I want 
is responsibility of your health adding to my list of problems."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 bit her lips, his harsh tone grating her. Her attempt at concern had 
obviously fire backed. However, she decided not to blow it out of 
proportions. "Fine," she said, submitting. Joe was a bit taken aback 
because he expected her to throw a tantrum. "I'm leaving then."</p><p> </p><p>"Thank God," Joe murmured, his tone wounding her.</p><p> </p><p>She
 stood up, sucking in a breath. "I just wanted to have a chat, and maybe
 you know, just spend a little time together for the holiday. Besides 
you were all alone. I was stupid to care for a jerk like you who doesn't
 even give a damn about me. I thought we were friends. Apparently, I 
thought wrong."</p><p> </p><p>God, she must have been crazy. Who was she
 kidding? Joe Cheng didn't need anyone to care for him. After all, he 
was the cold prince--the unfeeling, the untouchable and unreachable. She
 was silly to think she could thaw him.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel went back to
 the house, feeling depressed as ever. God, stupid Ariel. Why are you so
 flustered about this guy?! Who cares if he didn't want you as a friend?
 It's his loss.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel soothed her nerves. But god, it 
hurt. She couldn't understand why. He had rejected her numerous times; 
was this any different? Why, then, was the pain so much more... heavy? 
It was close to the point of being unbearable. Ariel cursed, mesmerizing
 herself that she couldn't possibly have any feelings for this guy. No. 
After the contract was signed, all feelings had been chopped off.</p><p> </p><p>"Look,
 you're all alone and abandoned now. Where are your friends, huh?" 
Suddenly, two girls approached Ariel with sinister smirks. They were 
right in front of the door leading to the backyard, so there weren't 
anybody nearby.</p><p> </p><p>"What do you want?" Ariel spat, annoyed.</p><p> </p><p>"How about your submission?" One of the girls snarled. "Give up, Joe, bitch."</p><p> </p><p>"Sure,
 have him all you want!" Ariel snapped. "I don't give a damn." She 
brushed pass them, but her rudeness had grated the girls far too much 
for them to dismiss her.</p><p> </p><p>"Wei, come back here," the same 
girl hissed, grabbing Ariel back. "How dare you talk to me in that tone!
 What do you take me as? A begger?!"</p><p> </p><p>"Aren't you?" Ariel sneered back. "Begging for your prince Joe? Well, tell you what. He's available! I'm giving it to you!"</p><p> </p><p>"You fucking slut," The girl grabbed Ariel. "You don't talk to me like that!"</p><p> </p><p>"And
 -you- don't touch my girlfriend like that." Suddenly, Joe appeared 
behind them. His frost eyes immediately stopped all electrical activity 
of the girls' hearts. As he made his way towards her, Ariel was turned 
dumbfounded.</p><p> </p><p>"Joe--" the same girl attempted to explain to
 him but he completely ignored her as he slipped his hands into Ariel's 
and jerked her away from the scene, ignoring the girls' calling after 
them.</p><p> </p><p>"W-what are you doing--whoa!" Ariel almost lost her 
balance when Joe pulled her into the living room, where the teens were 
all singing karaoke. The adults were in the dining room, chattering 
among themselves, but when they saw Joe and Ariel, the couple of 
everyone's interest and curiosity, their conversations immediately came 
to a halt as they wondered what was going on.</p><p> </p><p>Joe grabbed a
 microphone from a boy's hands. With a calmly poised and dynamic tone, 
he spoke, "I don't know why people are still so flustered about my 
matters, but I'm telling everyone now. Ariel is my girlfriend, and 
nothing is going to change that. So unless you want to offend me, stop 
harassing my girlfriend."</p><p> </p><p>His speech was short and curt, 
but it was enough to blow everyone's mind and break every girl's heart 
that wasn't Ariel's. She was completely shocked and could only stare at 
him in speechlessness. He, on the other hand, harbored no exact emotion.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh my...” Gillian exclaimed among a sudden burst of murmurs among the crowd. Rainie's jaw had dropped to the floor.</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 pulled Ariel in front of the Christmas tree, hugging her small frame 
from behind. He turned to Rainie, his vexed expression surfacing. "Wei, 
are you going to take the pictures or not?!" He snapped frostily.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie's lips were quivering as she nodded and prepared her camera, still speechless as ever.</p><p> </p><p>But
 nobody was more speechless than Ariel was. As he pulled her closer 
towards him, she could feel the thunderous beating of her heart and the 
hotness that was flushing her face. They were so intimate in proximity 
she could feel the warmth emanating from his body. What just happened? 
Was this a dream? Everything felt so surreal.</p><p> </p><p>She didn't want to think about such matters at the moment. Right now, she just wanted to cherish this heartwarming closeness.</p><p> </p><p>"Merry
 Christmas... friend," he slowly whispered into her ears, making her 
slightly jump in his embrace but he only smirked as he pulled her 
closer.</p><p> </p><p>Gradually, Ariel found her normalcy to bear smiles at the camera.</p><p> </p><p>It was probably the best gift she'd ever received.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Ah,
 this chapter is quite short compared to the last few chapters, but 
there wasn't much drama in this one. :] Hope you guys like it. As you 
noticed, it's now Christmas. The bet ends in exactly two months and a 
half or so, but you'll see that the last month will zoom by very fast 
unlike the first few weeks. :] Hope you guys continue to leave your 
comments, and thank you for reading! </p><p>A sneak peak to what's going
 to happen in the next chapter: a double date with Ariel&amp;Joe and 
Rainie&amp;Ethan! Stay tuned! ^_^</p><p>&lt;3 Bunny Ears
