<p class="tocn"></p><h4><!--Subtitle begin-->The Dare<!--Subtitle end--></h4>
<!--Chapter begin-->
"'I watches the show'?" Old Mr. Wang peered down at the disinterested 
Ariel with disapproval. "Miss Lin, this is obviously incorrect. Your 
grammar is getting worse and worse. Is there an explanation to this?"<p>Ariel
 shrugged casually, not even bothering to suppress the yawn. All right, 
so she knew English wasn't her best subject, but who cares when she was 
passing the class without instilling an extra ounce of effort, right? 
She hated foreign languages and there was no probable reason to study 
for something you obviously just can never seem to get. Espeically 
boring English.</p><p>Mr. Wang's eyes scanned down the paper; the color 
on his face grew paler and paler as more mistakes jumped out to taunt 
his eyes. He closed them for a short moment, relaxing his mind before 
anger and disappointment could consume him and ignite his urge to lash. 
"Miss Lin! I demand an explanation!"</p><p>"Obviously, teacher, English 
isn't what I do best," Ariel told him countless times. "There is no 
reason to get angry over this. I am still passing this class."</p><p>"With a C-!" Mr. Wang hissed indignantly. "Miss Lin, do you have any idea what this means?"</p><p>"Umm,"
 Ariel glanced at the ceiling, pretending to be in deep thought. Yet, 
she could care less what he was implying. "I don't know. I'm just not 
academically inclined?"</p><p>Poor Mr. Wang was flaring his nostrils, 
huffing in disbelief. However, knowing fully well his student's 
personality and her abilities, he heaved a resigned sigh. "Look, Miss 
Lin. You are a smart girl. If only you would try harder and not neglect 
your duty, you have a very high chance of improving your scores..."</p><p>"Thank
 you Mr Wang for believing in me," Ariel smiled. "But I'm just not the 
type of student you should bet on. Why don't you go and spend your time 
lecturing on someone who has a better chance than me? Like.. um... 
Gillian! She's a smartie."</p><p>Mr. Wang rolled his eyes. "Yes. She is 
very intelligent which is why I do not need to lecture her on the 
importance of grades. She knows her responsibilities and is very serious
 about her work. You, on the other hand, lack discipline--"</p><p>"Ah! I
 have to get home now!" Ariel squealed frantically, widening her eyes as
 they peered down at her watch. "Sorry, Mr. Wang, we shall continue this
 conversation some other time. Gotta hop now, see ya!"</p><p>She slammed
 the door shut, relief crossing her features. Ariel knew Mr. Wang only 
had good intentions to pull her out after class, but seeing him on a 
daily basis after school was starting to churn her patience for the man.
 Right, he was indeed a good teacher, but how many times had she wanted 
to tell him that his effort was only futile? There was no way to install
 dedication in her, especially one to academics.</p><p>Ariel was stalking down the hallways when her two best friends came catching up to her.</p><p>"Hey! So how did the lecture goes?" Rainie Yang teased, her eyes laughing. "Did Mr. Wang go easy on you?"</p><p>"You know, he's always the big blabbermouth," Ariel replied. "Nothing new from him, that's for sure."</p><p>Gillian
 Chung studied her friend, tilting her glasses as she grew an urge to 
encourage Mr. Wang's cause. "You know, he's right, though. You should 
start taking his advice."</p><p>"Are you kidding me? Unless the world 
turns upside down, Ariel would never take anyone's advice! Let alone, 
Mr. Wang's," Rainie threw in.</p><p>"Yes, but still... You should start 
thinking about your future," Gillian advised wisely. She knew about 
Ariel's tendency to be lazy in her dedication to work, but she still 
believed that if Ariel was given enough encouragement, her friend could 
actually turn a new leaf. "Imagine how happy your grandpa would be if 
you can just raise your average score with a few points."</p><p>"Yeah, 
yeah. That is just one of the MANY expectations he has for me... Think 
about it. Even if I satisfied this one, he'll just expect me to complete
 another one. Why bother at all, then, right?" Ariel smirked 
triumphantly. "Besides, I'm good in P.E."</p><p>Gillian sighed, knowing 
that she was losing an argument. It was never her nature to persist so 
adamantly in debates, anyway. "Whatever floats your boat..." She 
murmured lightly.</p><p>"Come on! We have to hurry. There's a basketball
 game today, remember?" Rainie's eyes suddenly sparked with a lurid 
gleam. "I can't wait to see him!!"</p><p>"Who?" Ariel quirked her 
eyebrows suspiciously. Sure, she knew Rainie had a habit of being 
boy-crazy, but sometimes, she just didn't understand how fickle the girl
 was. One time, she could be dedicated to the nice boy next door and 
then another, she would be swooning over the silent, autistic guy in the
 corner. Well, if there was anything Ariel and Rainie shared in common, 
it would be their incapability to commitment.</p><p>"The new basketball champion!" Rainie excalimed exuberatingly, dreamy eyes staring off into wonderland.</p><p>"Technically, he's not a champion if the game hasn't finished yet..." Gillian pointed out. "Is he that popular?"</p><p>"Of course! Who doesn't know Joe Cheng?" Rainie's eyes lit up with unabashed pride for a guy she hardly knew.</p><p>The
 familiar name rang in Ariel's ears. Sure, she knew who Joe Cheng was. 
In fact, he was the very neighbor next door to the house she had lived 
in for over ten years. But whatever. She was never interested in his 
affairs and the fact that he was the basketball so-called 'champion' 
imposed no impact on her. </p><p>"Who the hell he is, isn't any of my 
concern," Ariel snapped impatiently. "I'm going to the arcade. If you 
guys want to watch the game so much, then okay, just leave me alone!"</p><p>Rainie's
 merciless fingers prevented her from proceeding, however. An evil smirk
 ran across her face as Rainie gripped tightly onto Ariel. "Come on, 
Ariel. Stop acting all that. You know you're just like the rest of us, 
dreaming to have a boyfriend just like him."</p><p>"No, I don't--"</p><p>"Why, are you still thinking about Mike?"</p><p>The mention of her ex-boyfriend made Ariel's blood boil with loathing. "That's the last thing I'll ever do!!"</p><p>"Good. For a second, I was afraid that you're still trapped in his evil clutches," Rainie said.</p><p>"I'm trapped in yours right now," Ariel murmured, trying to break free. "Let go, Rainie!"</p><p>Gillian
 had been observing from the side carefully, used to the bickering her 
two best friends had often engaged in. Yet, this time, she had to admit 
that Rainie had sped a bit too far, for she could discern the pain in 
Ariel's eyes when Mike was mentioned. Rainie could be so careless in her
 behavior. Gillian decided to help out. "Come on, Rainie. Just let her 
go."</p><p>"No!" Rainie protested adamantly. In a snap of a finger, her 
face perked up brightly as though she had just figured out a 
million-dollared question. "Look, Ariel! I have the most fantastic idea 
ever!!!" Both her friends were gawking at her suspiciously, wondering 
what Rainie was about to blurt out. "Since you said that you're over 
Mike, why don't you pursue Joe?"</p><p>"What on Earth are you talking about? I don't even know him--"</p><p>"I heard rumors say that he's gay because he has never had a girlfriend before--"</p><p>"So? What does that have to do with me?!" Ariel was almost shouting.</p><p>"I
 want you two to go out!! See if the rumor is true or not!" Rainie 
exclaimed as she clasped her hands together. "Wouldn't that be perfect 
entertainment?!"</p><p>Ariel rolled her eyes. "Look, you're the one who's crazy about him, not me. Why don't YOU chase after him?"</p><p>Rainie sighed. "I would... but I already have my target!"</p><p>"Surprise, surprise, the fickle girl has finally found her match!" Ariel said sarcastically.</p><p>"Hey,
 I am not fickle! I'm pretty decisive, you see." Realizing that they 
were going off topic, Rainie instantly switched it back. "Look, Ariel! 
It'll be fun. What do you say? Want to try out this dating experiment?"</p><p>By
 now, Ariel had successfully yanked away from Rainie's persistant claws.
 Eager to escape from her lunatic of a friend, Ariel dashed down the 
hallways, quickly waving a good-bye. "No thank you! I have better things
 to do, unlike you!" The last thing she heard was Rainie's disappointed 
squeal and Gillian's soothing voice attemping to calm down the 
tempestuous girl.</p><p>Much to her chagrin, Rainie words did have their
 influence, for her mind was now being bombarded with the images of 
Mike. Her friend was right... If she was over Mike, shouldn't she be 
able to move on? Shouldn't she prove to her friends that she had already
 recovered from her broken relationship?</p><p>Foolish! Ariel thought and immediately delivered herself a slap. Don't lose your mind now!</p><p>Besides, even if she wanted to date, Joe Cheng wouldn't be one of her choices for numerous reasons.</p><p>First
 of all, he was the DEADLIEST attraction of all females, the ultimate 
magnet. She wasn't sure if she even had that many lives to date someone 
unhealthily adored by the masses.</p><p>Secondly, he was rumored to be 
GAY. He rejected every single girl, whether she was gorgeously beautiful
 or plain hideous. It would be a waste of time pursuing him, not to 
mention, a joke.</p><p>Thirdly, he was known as the COLD prince. He 
brushed off everyone like flicking dusts. Apparently, he had a kind of 
superiority complex that would probably break even a King's self-esteem.
 God damn it, he just didn't have a heart.</p><p>Ariel pulled on her 
sling bag. The idea of dating experiment was a bit exciting, truth be 
told. For the last seventeen years of her life, nothing had ever fallen 
out of the line of normalcy. She was the perfect example of a plain 
Jane, sporting average looks and grades and a couple of admirers. This 
could absolutely serve as the big time entertainment she'd been yearning
 for. And besides she was single for some time already...</p><p>Ariel shook her head. What am I thinking? I must not let Rainie get to me!</p><p>She was on her way out of the school when she crashed into someone.</p><p>"Ariel?"</p><p>She looked up. Oh my god. Please don't tell me it's him.</p><p>"Ariel?"</p><p>Ariel
 plastered on a stiff smile, disinclined to portray any awkwardness. "Hi
 Mike. How are you doing?" she asked. Her tone had never sounded so 
fake.</p><p>Mike gazed at her. She wanted to poke his eyes out for fixing such an intense gaze but she restrained herself. "I'm fine."</p><p>God,
 she could never ever forget the night he dumped her. She loved him so 
much. How could he? They had dated for so long. Everyone thought that 
they were going to grow up marrying. Mrs. He as people would tease her. 
Yet, three months ago, he cruelly crushed her heart with three simple 
words.</p><p>"Let's break up."</p><p>She remembered it so vividly, his 
reluctant tone, his cold eyes as he grabbed onto his new girlfriend and 
declared to her their ended romance.</p><p>And his reason?</p><p>"I don't love you anymore."</p><p>It was by far the most hurtful phrase she had ever heard in her entire life.</p><p>"That's good," Ariel replied, pulling her gaze away. She felt his burning eyes on her. What the hell?</p><p>"Mike!" </p><p>Ariel
 turned sideways and saw a girl running up towards them. She had to 
admit, the girl was drop dead gorgeous. Nonetheless, a beauty without a 
brain.</p><p>"Hebe," Mike acknowledged his girlfriend as she wrapped her
 arms around his with the sweetest smile Ariel had ever seen. "I was 
looking for you."</p><p>"Aww. So was I." She let out a shy giggle. Then,
 her eyes flickered towards Ariel, finally noticing her presence. "Oh...
 Hi Ariel."</p><p>Ariel nodded, not knowing what to say. Hebe's voice 
was honeyed with so much sweetness that anyone would melt upon hearing 
her voice.Her face was radiant of innocence and Ariel knew why Mike was 
so attracted towards her. Of course, with such a beauty, every man is 
bound to fall in love with her. Yet, Ariel could never bring herself to 
hate Hebe. Ever. There was just something about the girl that made her 
impossible to despise. Perhaps, it was her naive expression, her angelic
 appearance, and saccharine voice. Whatever it was, Hebe would forever 
retain the position of the world's most lovable princess.</p><p>"Let's go, Mike. My dad's waiting outside." Hebe pulled Mike towards the exit.</p><p>"Bye Ariel..." He murmured.</p><p>Ariel
 watched them leave, feeling a sharp pang at her heart. Stop it! She 
screamed at herself. You've broken up with him. You're completely over 
him! Stop harboring useless hope!</p><p>She ran to the bathroom and 
splashed cold water on her face, clearing at once her yearnings. Ariel 
replayed the encounter in her mind. Had she appeared abnormal? The bad 
thing about bumping into your ex again was facing him with his new 
girlfriend. If only she had a boyfriend to show him that she was 
completely and absolutely over him!</p><p>If only...</p><p>---------------------------------------</p><p>How's
 the chapter, you guys? Is it interesting enough? We tried our best, 
lol. A big thank you to the commenters!! This is for you!</p><p>Love,<br>Bunny Ears &amp; Nhu
