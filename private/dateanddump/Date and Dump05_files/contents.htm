<p class="tocn"></p><h4><!--Subtitle begin-->Same Old Question, Same Old Answer<!--Subtitle end--></h4>
<!--Chapter begin-->
"I am so excited! Oh Grandfather Lin, there are so many things I want to
 pray for, especially for Joe's romance," Mrs. Cheng babbled with joyful
 giggles. The group of four was walking the trail to the Zhao Dong 
temple, known for its picturesque sights and accurate readings.<p> </p><p>Ariel
 glanced at Joe. As expected, his infamous annoyed look scattered on his
 expression. Ariel couldn't resist the temptation to tease him about it.
 "Why does your mom want you to get a girlfriend so bad?" she whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Joe's eyes glanced down at her with irritation. It was typical of him to brush her comments as though they were passing wind.</p><p> </p><p>"She
 worries about you're being gay, huh?" Ariel asked, stifling her 
giggles. "I don't blame her. I would be too if I had a son who doesn't 
even give girls a look."</p><p> </p><p>He sharpened his gaze. "What did you say?" He dared her to repeat.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 skipped a bit ahead, laughing uncontrollably. "Hey, Joe! When are you 
coming out of the closet? I'd definitely support your decision!"</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 clenched his fists as he shot her an I'm-going-to-kill-you look but 
Ariel only laughed with total mirth, not giving a care in the world. So,
 besides acting cool and being annoyed all the time, the cold prince 
actually had a temper too! It was such an amazing discovery that Ariel 
couldn't resist the urge to laugh.</p><p> </p><p>"You, come back here," Joe seethed.</p><p> </p><p>Mrs. Cheng looked up ahead to see what the laughing was all about and couldn't help but smile seeing the two.</p><p> </p><p>"Grandfather Lin, don't you think they make a good match?"</p><p> </p><p>Grandfather
 Lin gazed at the two teenagers up ahead and raised an eyebrow in 
contemplation. “Indeed.” He stroke his beard, nodding.</p><p> </p><p>"They're having so much fun. I've never seen Joe interact with a girl like that."</p><p> </p><p>"Don't
 worry, I'll keep it a secret," Ariel said tauntingly, sticking out her 
tongue at Joe. His angry expression was so rare that she just wanted to 
tease him more to see it.</p><p> </p><p>"Have you said enough?" Joe hissed.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 shook her head. "No!" There was simply no way she would abandon a 
chance for revenge. All of these while, he had been insulting and 
looking down on her. It was about time he should have a taste of his own
 medicine. "Hey, I have a couple of gay friends. If you want, I can 
introduce them to you."</p><p> </p><p>Joe's eyes widened as he looked ahead with caution, hoping that no one heard such absurdity. "You better watch your mouth--"</p><p> </p><p>"Or what? You'll chop me to death?" Ariel stuck out her tongue again.</p><p> </p><p>"No, but I'll make sure your life at school will be a living hell."</p><p> </p><p>"Is
 that a threat? Ooo, the cold prince is getting angry!" Ariel smiled 
with weighty mock. She could perfectly see that he was on the brink of 
explosion. Having never seen this side to him, it was all the more 
amusing. "Okay, okay, I'll stop. Look at your face. It's like you want 
to kill somebody."</p><p> </p><p>"That person is you, of course." Joe remarked.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 was about to combat but knowing that she should not give him the 
satisfaction of seeing her angry, she ignored him and plastered on a 
smile. I'm going to let you go this time since we're on a date, Ariel 
giggled. Oh my god. I'm already on a date with Joe! Next, I'm going to 
make him my boyfriend. This is all too easy, too easy!! The next thing I
 know, I'll see that pissed off look on Mike's face.</p><p> </p><p>Joe 
smirked when he witnessed her spaced out look. He, more or less, had 
already seen the motive in her insistence on getting a date with him. Of
 course, he wouldn't let her bag the satisfaction she'd been longing 
for. "Look, today's date is simply just an outing as neighbors. There is
 nothing more to it. I don't want any rumors spreading in school because
 of this, you hear me? Don't even tell a soul about today's event."</p><p> </p><p>The
 joy on Ariel's face instantly vanished like one two three. She gazed at
 him. "Why?" That meant that she couldn't even tell Rainie or Gillian. 
But that was the whole damn point to the date!!</p><p> </p><p>"Because I said so."</p><p> </p><p>Joe tossed his hands into his jeans' pockets and strode on ahead.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel ran after him. "What are you going to do if I told?" She challenged him.</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 paused in his steps, turning to glance at her. The mischief lurking in 
his eyes were shining with sinister dust that Ariel couldn't help but 
feel alarmed. "Then you can definitely kiss the idea of dating me 
goodbye." He was so close she could hear him breathing onto her.</p><p>Ariel blinked her eyes. 'What is this?' She asked. 'Why is he saying it as though he knows what my motive is?'</p><p> </p><p>"So what if you don't date me?" Ariel ticked off, wanting to test what he knew. "It's not like I like you all that much anyway."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh
 really? You sure you want to blow all the chances you have with me?" 
Joe asked, inching closer and invading her space. "I heard about you and
 your ex-boyfriend, as well as his new girlfriend. It makes perfect 
sense why you want to date me because of him, does it not?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel's eyes inflated in shock.</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 smirked. "The school is not blind, you know; that includes me. I knew 
what was on your mind the moment you said you want to date me even 
though you don't even like me."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel regained her 
composure. So what if he knew? He only got half of the story right. He 
would never imagine that this was all a challenge! She'd never let him 
know either. Judging from his personality, he'd completely ignore her 
for the rest of her life if he ever found out and Ariel didn't want 
that. At least not before she get to spite Mike.</p><p> </p><p>"You're 
even more pathetic than I first thought," Joe continued, finally 
withdrawing away from her vicinity. "Don't you have anything better to 
do? Play such childish games." He strutted ahead.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel 
chased after him, anger increasing. "Wei, who is childish? Didn't you 
agree to date me because you wanted to avoid that Jolin Tsai? Now, that 
isn't childish?!" She glared at him.</p><p> </p><p>"Wei, do you even 
know what childish means? I'm just using you as an excuse--that's called
 smart. While you, on the other hand, are willing to abandon all pride 
and dignity to chase after me just to spite your old boyfriend. That's 
pretty childish, don't you think?"</p><p> </p><p>"You..." Ariel chucked him a maddened grimace. She was so angry she was breathless. How dare he make fun of her!</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 smirked. She was idiotic enough to buy all of what he said as logic and
 reasoning. "Well, well, well, if you worry about me blabbering about 
this, then don't you worry. I'll keep it a secret," he said mockingly, 
sticking out his tongue at her.</p><p> </p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p> </p><p>"Here
 Ariel, take them," Mrs. Cheng handed Ariel a few incense sticks. Ariel 
took them gracefully and uttered a polite thank you. Mrs. Cheng giggled 
happily. "Oh, you're such a sweet young lady!"</p><p> </p><p>Grandfather Lin observed Joe with increasing approval. "Young man, you're very handsome and tall."</p><p> </p><p>Joe nodded politely, thanking him for his compliments.</p><p> </p><p>"You know, from the moment I first saw you, I instantly knew you were the perfect candidate to inherit this temple."</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 gazed at the old man, befuddled. "Um, pardon me?" But Grandfather Lin 
just smiled gaily and stroked his beard in nods, eyes studying the young
 man before him intently and unreservedly.</p><p> </p><p>Joe felt 
uncomfortable as he bowed before the Buddha statue. He knew all of this 
were stupid superstition, but just for the sake of politeness and his 
mother, he obliged to do the silly rituals.</p><p> </p><p>"Time for your destinies to be told!" Grandfather Lin exclaimed.</p><p> </p><p>So
 the whole ritual was a tiring process. Joe had no problems with the 
sticks, but he couldn't help but plastered on a vexed expression 
throughout the process. Ariel, on the other hand, was far off worse. She
 couldn't even shake the thing right, always ending up with several 
sticks on the floor.</p><p> </p><p>Minutes and hours passed, and before 
they knew it, the sun had already gone down. Grandfather Lin both 
suggested that they stay for a night much to Joe and Ariel's annoyance. 
He asked the both of them to fetch the extra blankets in one of the 
temple rooms and with much grunts and grumbles, Ariel agreed to lead 
Joe.</p><p> </p><p>"Why is it that you agreed to go on this date?!" 
Ariel grumbled. First of all, being stuck in this place for a whole 
night wasn't her ideal plan of spending her weekend. Secondly, she was 
getting pissed off at every passing minute with Joe. And third of all, 
after he threatened her to keep this event a secret, there was simply no
 point in going along with this stupid date anymore!</p><p> </p><p>"You're really strange. You were the one who wanted me to come along. Now that I did, you're complaining." Joe remarked.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 wanted to spit back an acidic response, but knowing that she couldn't 
let him know more than what he already knew, she unwillingly closed her 
mouth and suffered the injustice.</p><p> </p><p>"Come on, hurry up. You're stupid as a pig, but I didn't know you were slow as a turtle."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel shot him murderous eyes. "I'm not stupid okay?!"</p><p> </p><p>"Stupid people always say that."</p><p> </p><p>"You
 think you're so smart?" Ariel huffed, dumping all of the blankets in 
her arms onto the ones in his. "Fine, then you carry them all since 
you're so smart." With a look of contempt she crossed her arms and 
stomped towards the door.</p><p> </p><p>However, when she tried to slide the door open, it wouldn't budge.</p><p> </p><p>"What is wrong with this thing?" Ariel asked, banging the door.</p><p> </p><p>Joe rolled his eyes. "Come on now. Don't tell me you don't even know how to open a door."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel glared at him penetratingly, but she turned back to try the door again. "It won't budge!"</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 let out a grumble and placed the blankets on the floor down. "Move," he
 hissed and grabbed at the door, trying to slide it. But the result was 
the same. The door would not inch a bit.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel laughed with weighty mock. "Ha-ha-ha! Look! The genius can't even open a door!"</p><p> </p><p>Rolling his eyes, he tried again. This time, he felt someone presence outside.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh my god! I am so sorry you guys!" It was his mother's voice.</p><p> </p><p>"Ma!" Joe banged on the door with waning patience. "Open the door!"</p><p> </p><p>"I would really love to honey, but I accidentally locked it. Now, I don't know where I put the key!"</p><p> </p><p>"Ma, stop joking around!"</p><p> </p><p>"Grandfather Lin, what should we do?" He heard his mother asked.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, I don't know. There is very little we can do without the key," Grandfather Lin said solemnly.</p><p> </p><p>"No! Don't tell me I have to get stuck with this jerk for the rest of my life?" Ariel shrieked. "Grandpa! You have to save me!"</p><p> </p><p>Joe rolled his eyes. "Grandpa, don't you have a spare key somewhere?"</p><p> </p><p>"No," came the brisk reply that was quick as the wind. "I don't."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh my god!" Ariel cried. "Grandpa! I'm going to be stuck in here forever!"</p><p> </p><p>"You
 two stay in there for the night. It's so dark right now. We'll look for
 the key tomorrow morning okay?" Mrs. Cheng suggested.</p><p> </p><p>"What? No--" Ariel was about to protest.</p><p> </p><p>"Goodnight,
 you two! Those blankets should suffice. If you need more heat, the 
other person can provide that!" Grandfather Lin said. With hushed 
giggles, the two adults left the premise, leaving Joe and Ariel 
completely alone and locked up.</p><p> </p><p>"Great!" Ariel scoffed sarcastically, throwing her arms in the air. "Who would have thought!"</p><p> </p><p>"It's
 not like I want to get stuck with you either," Joe said solemnly, 
sitting down on the floor. He began to make his bed with the blankets.</p><p> </p><p>He
 was so calm Ariel could not believe it. How in the world could he 
maintain such composure when they were stuck in such a terrible 
circumstance? She wasn't even the least bit close to patient, let alone 
calm.</p><p> </p><p>"Are you going to sleep standing?" Joe asked.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 chucked him a glare before grabbing the blankets and going to the 
opposite side of the room. She was going to make sure they were as far 
as possible. Who knew what things he might do to her in the deadest 
moments of the night.</p><p> </p><p>"Isn't that a bit too exaggerated?" Joe looked at the vast distance between them. They were at the exact opposites of the room.</p><p> </p><p>"No.
 Nothing is exaggerated with protecting myself from a wolf like you," 
Ariel spat. "I am a good girl. I will not take any risk of losing my 
virginity--" She paused short, realizing she had leaked such a personal 
detail.</p><p> </p><p>Joe smirked. "I'm not interested in taking your virginity. Even if you're naked right now, I still wouldn't be interested."</p><p> </p><p>"It's the other way around! I wouldn't be interested if you were naked!"</p><p> </p><p>"Oh yeah?" Joe challenged. "Would you like to see?"</p><p> </p><p>"No!"
 Ariel shrieked, covering her head with the blankets. "Now shut up so I 
can go to sleep." Under the weight of her blankets, she did not hear a 
reply. As she lay there, she still couldn't believe the fact that she 
was sharing a room with the school's cold prince, Joe Cheng. A few days 
earlier, they didn't even talk to each other.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel's mind
 froze in terror. A week had almost passed and all she did was getting 
him to hate her. God, this was more challenging than she first thought. 
She as hell didn't want to entertain the idea of going out with him. If 
she had known how unbearable he was, she wouldn't even take up the 
stupid challenge.</p><p> </p><p>But now, it was too late. She must 
persist. It was not her character to quit so easily. At least right now,
 she had gotten him to a date. If she was able to make him like her even
 just a bit right now, then it wouldn’t long before they'll start going 
out. By then, she'd win the challenge and prove herself to Mike and her 
friends.</p><p> </p><p>Yet at this rate, it was impossible to make him fall in love with her.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 bit her lips. Had she acted too harsh on Joe all of these while? God 
damn it; there was just no chance that he'd come to like her. She 
shouldn't have been too feisty!</p><p> </p><p>Wait a minute. A splendid idea suddenly hit her. Since Joe already knew her motive then why didn't she take advantage of that?</p><p> </p><p>"Hey, Joe?" Ariel asked.</p><p> </p><p>No answer.</p><p> </p><p>She
 peeked from her blanket. Seeing his unnatural breathing, she knew he 
wasn't sleeping just yet and that he was blatantly just being mean. Not 
caring about such trivial things at the moment, Ariel scurried over to 
his side of the room with her blankets, dropping on her bum right beside
 his figure.</p><p> </p><p>"Wei," she called. "Why don't we make a deal."</p><p> </p><p>Joe ignored her.</p><p> </p><p>"Hmmm. Since you already know my purpose for chasing after you, why don't you just help me? Pretend to be my boyfriend?"</p><p> </p><p>"Dream on," he murmured.</p><p> </p><p>"Come
 on," Ariel nudged him with a saccharine voice, sweet enough to eat. 
"Help me please? After all, you're already doing it anyway. We're on a 
date, aren't we? Soon enough, we'd become a couple. So why not just 
speed it up a little and let's go out?"</p><p> </p><p>"No."</p><p> </p><p>"Please."</p><p> </p><p>"No."</p><p> </p><p>"Come on, please? It's not a big deal right? You don't like me, I don't like you. We’re just going to be acting!"</p><p> </p><p>"I said, no!"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 was getting angry. Here she was, discarding her pride and dignity and 
begging him, and yet he didn't even appreciate it! Did he know how much 
she just sacrificed just to ask him for this one favor? Ariel had never 
felt so insulted in her life. How many times had she done this just to 
beg him? God, it was sickening!</p><p> </p><p>"Fine! Stupid jerk!" Ariel spat, punching him.</p><p> </p><p>"Wei!"
 Joe glared at her. "Don't you have any shame? You come to ask me for a 
favor and hit me when I don't agree? What kind of person are you? No 
logic at all!"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel's eyes glazed with fire. "What did you say?"</p><p> </p><p>"For
 a loud person like you, you're pretty close to deaf." He shifted in his
 position and scooted far away from her, as though she was a contagious 
disease.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel couldn't contain her infuriation any 
longer. He pretty much blew her up into insanity with his inconsiderate 
harsh remarks. "You know what? I don't care anymore. I'll come to school
 on Monday and announce we went out on a date. Since you're unwilling to
 go out with me in any case, why should I respect your wishes to make 
this a secret? Hmph."</p><p> </p><p>Joe's eyes opened immediately in alarm. When Ariel saw his reaction, she snickered inside.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh,
 and imagine how surprised people will be! The cold prince who has never
 went out with anybody actually gone out on a date with me, the 
beautiful gorgeous Ariel Lin! By then, your reputation is totally 
tarnished isn't it? The cold prince, after all, isn't so cool. He is 
still like any other man on earth, unable to resist the temptation of a 
beautiful woman."</p><p> </p><p>"Nobody will believe you," Joe commented, smirking. "I'll just deny it. What can you do?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel fumed. "Well, I'll take pictures."</p><p> </p><p>"Go
 ahead. You have a camera with you?" Joe smirked when Ariel realized she
 didn't. What was even worse was that she didn't even have a cell phone 
to do it. "Admit defeat, loser."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel suddenly remembered something and she smiled wickedly. "Jolin knows about our date."</p><p> </p><p>"So? She wouldn't spread anything around. Not when the person going out with me isn't her."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel got pissed off. "Come on, just help me out!"</p><p> </p><p>"No. No. N-O. Don't even think about it."</p><p> </p><p>For the rest of the night, Ariel continued to bug him. But his answer was forever unchanging.</p><p> </p><p>"No, no, no, no, NO!!!!!"</p><p>------------------------------------------------</p><p>The date doesn't end yet! Stay tuned for part 2 :)</p><p>Thank you every one for your wonderful comments. Hope you guys will continue to leave your thoughts. ^_~</p><p>Love,<br>Bunny Ears &amp; Nhu
