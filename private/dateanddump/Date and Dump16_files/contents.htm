<p class="tocn"></p><h4><!--Subtitle begin-->Surprise, Surprise, Surprise<!--Subtitle end--></h4>
<!--Chapter begin-->
Ariel was throwing her textbooks into her locker when Selina Ren dropped
 by, giving her a surprise. As far as Ariel was concerned, they were not
 friends nor enemies; they simply did not know each other. Ariel had to 
admit though, her first impression of Selina wasn't all that great due 
to her feeling envious toward Joe's special treatment toward Selina.<p>"Hi
 there," Selina greeted with a warm smile, yet Ariel was a bit too 
grouchy to acknowledge Selina's good intention at friendliness.</p><p>"Hi... how can I help you?" Ariel asked a bit dully, shutting her locker.</p><p>"Can we talk for a bit?" Selina said.</p><p>Her
 request was not an absurd one, but Ariel's eye instantly flung wide 
open in surprise. Now what business would Selina want to talk to her 
about? "Oh, huh, sure..." Despite an ominous feeling about this, Ariel 
decided to just go along the flow.</p><p>Five minutes later, the girls 
were sitting at an ice cream parlor down the street. Selina insisted 
that it was her treat, but Ariel blatantly refused. She didn't like to 
owe people's favors, especially those that she didn't know well.</p><p>"Come
 on! Don't worry about it. I feel very grateful that you're willing to 
spend time to talk to me. I have a great favor to ask of you, so just 
accept it, okay?" Selina's eyes shone brightly.</p><p>Ariel sighed, knowing that further rejection would only indicate narrow-mindedness. Reluctantly, she agreed.</p><p>"So what do you want to talk to me about?" Ariel straight-forwardly asked, disinterest flickering in her eyes.</p><p>Selina
 was staring at her intensely, her eyes sparkling in a kind of 
admiration Ariel couldn't quite fathom. "You're a friend of Joe, right?"</p><p>Ariel
 blinked. "Yeah," she said, shoving aside the 'deal' business. There was
 no reason to specify to Selina, for who knew that kind of motive she 
could harbor? Ariel blinked again, realizing that she was using a 
cynical mind to judge Selina. It couldn't be helped, though...</p><p>"I really admire you," Selina said. "I have never seen Joe so worried about a girl before. You're the first."</p><p>With
 each second she had of this conversation, Ariel find herself getting 
more and more surprised. "Really... How come I don't feel that way? He 
always insult me. Sometimes, he even ignores my existence. Doesn't care 
about me at all."</p><p>Selina chuckled. It was then Ariel realized how 
contagious her laugh was, and how beautiful she glowed. No wonder 
someone cold and untouchable like Joe couldn't help but be attracted to 
her. Who wouldn't be drawn to such a resplendently angelic face? Ariel 
felt herself simmering with rising envy.</p><p>"But at least, he reacts 
to you," Selina pointed out. "I mean, I've known him for a long time and
 beside me, he had never interacted with anyone else the way he 
interacts with you."</p><p>What was she trying to imply? Ariel thought. 
Was she declaring a battle? When two people want one thing, war is 
almost always the result.</p><p>"What do you think of him?" Ariel found herself asking.</p><p>"He's
 a great guy," Selina said, twirling with her ice cream. "Even though he
 may appear like someone who's too absorbed into his world, but 
actually, he can be very considerate and supportive. He was always there
 when I needed him most. We're like the bestest of friends."</p><p>"Oh..." But certainly, Joe didn't think so. Ariel found herself dreading the thought.</p><p>Selina turned an observant eye. "And you? What do you think of him?"</p><p>Ariel
 had a lot to say about Joe and how mean and cruel he was... How 
arrogant. She could spend days lashing out adjectives but they would 
never be enough to express her true repugnance for this man. However, 
Ariel knew that she had already softened to him, and some of those 
adjectives could no longer apply. She admitted that her impression of 
Joe was changing.</p><p>But that didn't mean she wanted to tell Selina the truth.</p><p>"He's incorrigible," Ariel simply spat.</p><p>"You may think so, but that's definitely not true," Selina told her. "I can see that you have some admiration for him, right?"</p><p>Ariel rose two eyebrows. "What if I say yes? What if no?"</p><p>"It
 doesn't matter, because I can tell that Joe truly does care for you," 
Selina said. "At first, I was a bit jealous of that." Here she chuckled,
 and Ariel grew even more alert. "But you know, I'm also happy that Joe 
is starting to open up his heart to other people. He's always been 
lonely. It's great that he has a friend."</p><p>"I guess," Ariel shrugged. She sure didn't like the term "friends" and how Selina used it. "Do you like him or something?"</p><p>Ariel could tell the way Selina's eyes stretched that she was a bit surprised at the directness. "Why do you say that?"</p><p>"I
 mean... ever since you came here, you're almost always around him," 
said Ariel, remembering the moments when she'd stared with envy. "Well, 
even if you don't, Joe certainly does." She didn't mean to have her tone
 sound so bitter, but it was too late to take it back.</p><p>Selina laughed again. "Yeah, we're really close, but we're just like brothers and sisters."</p><p>Incredulity marred Ariel's features. "What?"</p><p>"I only treat him as a brother."</p><p>"But--"</p><p>"There's no possibility between us," Selina said.</p><p>Somehow, Ariel felt a knot inside her loosen. "Oh..." Selina's honesty and straight-forwardness impressed her.</p><p>"Anyway,
 let's get to the point," Selina continued. "Joe's birthday is coming up
 this Friday and I'm arranging a surprise for him. Think you can come?"</p><p>For
 a moment, Ariel was astonished by the news, for Joe had never told her 
when his birthday was. Then again, there was no need to know because she
 knew Joe never liked celebrations or even social gatherings. But 
perhaps, Joe would accept it if it came from Selina, someone whom Ariel 
knew he had some type of special feelings for.</p><p>In a way, the 
thought saddened her a bit, and even for a moment discouraged her to 
participate. However, seeing Selina's hopeful face changed Ariel's mind.</p><p>"Sure," said Ariel. Somehow, she was feeling that Selina wasn't such a bad person that she thought.</p><p>"Great! But I'm going to have to ask you another favor," Selina lightheartedly said.</p><p>Ariel smiled. "I don't mind. What is it?"</p><p>"I want you to lead Joe to the surprise."</p><p>"Why me? I think it'll be better if you do it," Ariel said, not really liking the idea.</p><p>"But I'll be too busy preparing and all," Selina told her. "Come on. You're the only person that Joe would probably listen to."</p><p>"All right, then..." Ariel couldn't find a reason to object.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Ariel
 digged in her backpack to make sure the gift was there. Yup, there it 
was, intricately designed with glittering wrapping paper and fancy 
ribbons. She wasn't sure if Joe would like it, but a part of her was 
hoping he would.</p><p>She knew that she wasn't obliged to buy him any 
gift, but upon reflecting all those times when he protected her, Ariel 
knew that in her heart, she wanted him to give him something to show her
 utmost appreciation. He had called her cheesy before, and Ariel had to 
agree with a smile. She was cheesy, but definitely in a good way.</p><p>After
 school that day, Ariel quickly ran up to Joe before he could escape her
 sight. "Hey!" She greeted him cheerfully with a tap.</p><p>He gave no strong reaction ."Don't do that again."</p><p>"Why? Did I scare you?" Ariel teased.</p><p>"It looks stupid," he remarked with a smirk.</p><p>"Do
 you still think you calling me stupid, would affect me?" Ariel asked 
playfully. "You use that word too many times, I'm starting to think it's
 losing its meaning."</p><p>"Would you rather have me call you a bonehead?" Joe asked.</p><p>"Not
 that name again!" Ariel hissed irritatingly as she instantly brought up
 a hand to whack him in the head, but he skillfully dodged her attack, 
as though he knew beforehand her evil intention. "You would never stop, 
huh?"</p><p>"Just like you would never stop hitting on people."</p><p>Ariel sighed, giving up. "Whatever. Are you busy now?"</p><p>"I'm heading for basketball practice."</p><p>"Practice?!"
 Ariel's eyes bulged out unbelievingly. "Who practices on a Friday like 
this? Come on. Don't you have better things to do?"</p><p>Joe's 
quickened his pace in an attempt to reach his destination faster so he 
could avoid the yapping girl, but his effort was rebuked as Ariel saw 
through his motive and hastened as well. "The question should be 
directed at you. Why are you following me? Shouldn't you be out doing 
'better' things?" he mocked.</p><p>Yeah, like celebrating your birthday, Ariel thought. "Yes I do, but you must come with me."</p><p>Now he rose his eyebrows at her in suspicion. "What do you have planned?"</p><p>"Come
 on. Don't speak as though I'm a witch ready to execute her evil plans 
any minute now," Ariel said, rolling her eyes at her own exaggeration. 
"I'm not as cunning as you think."</p><p>"Cunning or not, I'm not interested."</p><p>God,
 why does he always have to do things that infuriate her? If it wasn't 
because she promised Selina, Ariel would have stormed off in indignation
 by now. "You are coming with me, whether or not you like it. Don't make
 me resort to violence."</p><p>"What do I get out of this?" Joe asked, beginning to relent.</p><p>"Hmmm,"
 Ariel plastered on a thinking face, purposely dragging out her 
syllables to make him squirm in anticipation. "You'll see," she said 
with a smirk. She curled her fingers around his arms in an attempt to 
secure him and terminate any thoughts of his to escape her unrelenting 
persistence. "I promise you won't lose anything! Perhaps you'll even 
thank me for this."</p><p>"Fine." His quick surrender took Ariel by 
surprise. It seemed as though it was getting easier and easier for her 
to convince him to do things her way. She could clearly remember in 
their first days, he had always kept a stern demeanor and would rarely 
succumb to her demands no matter how much she begged him. Now, though, 
Joe was beginning to give her the impression that he was trusting her. 
It made Ariel feel a wave of happiness.</p><p>"Okie dokes. You won't regret this." She winked mischievously as them.</p><p>"I'm starting to have an ominous feeling about this," Joe silently grumbled.</p><p>----------------------------------------------</p><p>"I'm leaving," Joe declared as he recognized the karaoke bar in the distance. "I'm not interested coming there with you."</p><p>"No! You must come! You can't back out now!!" Ariel tried her best to pull him back. "Believe me, you won't regret this!"</p><p>"I already regret coming with you," he snarled at her ears.</p><p>Ariel
 plastered on a smile and held tighter onto his arm. "You'll change your
 mind." Without so much as another word, she led him to the bar with a 
determined grip. When they reached the door of a room, Ariel released 
Joe and peered up at him. "See, it's not bad, is it?"</p><p>"What's the point of coming here, anyway?" He asked impatiently.</p><p>"Like I said, you'll see," Ariel told him. "So do you want me to knock, or you do it?"</p><p>Suspicion widened his eyes. "Don't tell me that you've planned a party or something."</p><p>Ariel shrugged, not willing to answer. "I guess I'll knock then." She rose her fist and knocked against the painted door.</p><p>"Come in!" A voice shouted inside.</p><p>Ariel
 could feel Joe's muscles tensing at the voice. He must have recognized 
that it belonged to someone he knew, she thought but quickly snapped out
 of it as she turned the knob.</p><p>"SURPRISE!!!!!"</p><p>Immediately, 
confetti was thrown everywhere as a chorus of shouting rang deafeningly 
in their ears. Even though Ariel knew ahead of the surprise, she 
couldn't help but feel shocked at such strong enthusiasm and lively 
voices. Joe was probably twice as surprised at she was.</p><p>Instantly 
afterwards, everyone was forced into a staring contest as silence 
consumed the air. Ariel looked over to Joe, who possessed a stone 
expression, as though the surprise wasn't even surprising at all. He 
didn't look pleased, nor did he look angry. His expression, if humanly 
possible, was expressionless. What was he thinking?</p><p>"Joe!" 
Selina's cheerful voice called out as she emerged from the crowd and 
flung her arms around the stiffened Joe. "Happy Birthday!!" She released
 him and held onto his hands intimately. The sight somewhat repelled 
Ariel. "I know that you don't like these kind of things, but it's your 
first birthday after I came back. We got to celebrate it! Do you like 
it?" she asked.</p><p>Ariel thought that the question wasn't necessary 
because Joe would probably never say anything to hurt her. It was 
amazing how much Joe was willing to stretch his tolerance just for the 
sake of Selina's happiness.</p><p>Joe nodded without saying a word as he
 reluctantly stepped inside. Happy smiling faces greeted him as his eyes
 scanned the room. Ariel couldn't even recognize some of the people 
there. She assumed that they must be Selina's friends because as far as 
she knew, Joe didn't associate with that many people.</p><p>"Come in! We were all waiting for you. Let's start this, yeah?" Selina said and clapped for everyone to start the party.</p><p>Ariel
 followed inside. She didn't know why she bothered coming because 
obviously, Joe had completely forgotten about her. Of course... With 
Selina here, his attention could not be drawn to anything else.</p><p>For
 the next hour, everyone was indulged in a good, party spirit, drinking 
and eating as though there was no tomorrow. Ariel sat at the side, 
feeling left out, but she knew she brought the misfortune upon herself. 
Who told her to agree to Selina? Who told her to come, anyway?</p><p>Yet
 deep in her heart, Ariel knew that she was glad she came. It was her 
first time celebrating Joe's birthday after all. As long as he was 
happy, she guessed her momentary loneliness was worth it.</p><p>She saw 
how his eyes glimmered when Selina said something to him. Right now, 
Selina was encouraging him to sing a song with her. Ariel had the urge 
to laugh out loud as his hesitant expression. Anyone could tell from the
 way his cheeks blushed that he didn't fancy the idea of humiliating 
himself, but in the end, he agreed anyway.</p><p>Surprisingly, he looked like he was having fun. Unlike Ariel.</p><p>She
 sighed and decided to head out, not wanting to see how Joe was staring 
amorously at Selina. They really looked like a couple back in there. 
Selina cared so much for Joe, and Joe for Selina. Ariel couldn't 
understand why Selina said they were only treating each other like 
brothers and sisters. She was beginning to think it was only a lie to 
cover up any true motives. Perhaps Selina was already planning to 
confess to Joe. That must be it. Maybe the reason she invited Ariel was 
because she wanted rub reality in Ariel's face.</p><p>Guess loneliness was making her pessimistic.</p><p>Ariel
 was standing out on the balcony, enjoy the night breeze. It was a lot 
less suffocating out here. She felt so much more comfortable.</p><p>She didn't know how long she was standing there, but the next thing she knew, she felt someone's presence beside her.</p><p>"Joe?" Ariel stared up in surprise. "What are you doing here? You should be having fun inside."</p><p>"It's too stuffy in there," Joe said and Ariel had to agree. "Why did you leave so soon?"</p><p>So
 he did noticed her after all. Ariel was beginning to think that her 
existence meant nothing to him, but she guessed that wasn't entirely 
true. "I was bored," she honestly confessed.</p><p>"You dragged us here,
 remember?" Joe reminded her. His tone was casual, but Ariel couldn't 
help but feel that he was pushing the blame on her.</p><p>"I promised Selina that I'd bring you here," Ariel told him, "What else could I do?"</p><p>"You didn't have to," Joe said.</p><p>Ariel stared at him in question. "Are you saying you regret coming here?"</p><p>"A bit." His answer shocked her. "But that's okay. I had a little fun."</p><p>Of course, Ariel thought biting at her lip. "Because of Selina, right?"</p><p>He
 gave her a nod. Even though she could see through his feelings for 
Selina, Ariel couldn't help but flinch at the confirmation. "I guess you
 should thank me, then, huh?"</p><p>"She’s very important to me," Joe said.</p><p>Ariel's
 heart pumped faster. It astonished her how direct he was in his 
confession. But a part of her felt sour at the fact that he was 
comfortable letting her know all of his feelings. Although it only 
indicated that their friendship had escalated to another level, it also 
told Ariel that he didn't consider the possibility of an advancement in 
their relationship.</p><p>"Oh," Ariel pretended that she was surprised. 
She felt her throat constricting in a narrow tube. "Well, erm… Do you 
think there’ll be progress in your relationship with her, then?"</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"I don't think she feels the same way," he said.</p><p>Ariel
 didn't think so. Despite what Selina told her, she still doubted that 
Selina didn't harbor any feelings for Joe. Why else would she go through
 so much troubles just for his birthday celebration? And also the way 
Selina looked at Joe, there had got to be something else dwelling in 
those eyes.</p><p>"I think you should go for it," Ariel said with a 
light smile. "Who knows, maybe your feelings are reciprocated. Even if 
it's not, you won't live with the regret of not telling her." Yeah, she 
was surprised at her own words herself, but Ariel had no confidence in 
her and Joe. Why hang onto something that's not real? She might as well 
wish Joe for his happiness.</p><p>He didn't say anything.</p><p>Ariel 
decided to break the silence as memory hit her. "Oh, right. Your 
present." She fished out the nicely wrapped box fron her bag.</p><p>"You know it's not necessary," Joe told her.</p><p>"It's
 all right. I wanted to, anyway," she told him and handed him the box. 
"Don't tell me you'll act like a cold prince and reject my good will?"</p><p>Joe took it graciously, smiling at her for the first time. "You want me to open it now?"</p><p>"Sure."</p><p>His
 fingers carefully unwrapped the box. He crumbled the wrapping paper, 
and flipped the box open, revealing a shiny pen. "Thanks," he said.</p><p>"Yeah, it's nothing," said Ariel. "But I immediately think of you when I saw that pen."</p><p>Joe chuckled. "Why?"</p><p>"You
 study English a lot, so I figure you'll need a pen to write all those 
essays," Ariel smirked, holding in her laughter. "Right, Genius Man?"</p><p>"Ha-ha, very funny," said Joe. "Anyway, I don't promise that I'll get you a present for your birthday, you know that, right?"</p><p>She
 nodded her head. "Who'd expect anything from someone stingy like you?" 
She pointed her nose high and scoffed irritably. "And I'm not the type 
of person who does things and expects a reward in return. Hmph."</p><p>Silence
 enveloped them for the next few seconds. Ariel felt a surge of words 
that she wanted to spit out but she didn't know where to start. She 
fumbled with her fingers nervously, uncertain, but as she turned to look
 at Joe, she knew that if she were wise, she'd have to let go of this 
sooner. "Joe?"</p><p>He turned to look at her. "What?"</p><p>"Umm..." 
Her heart was beating so rapidly upon his intense gaze. How could 
someone she disliked so much have the ability to make her nerves so 
shaky and abnormal? "There's something I have to do."</p><p>"What is that?" He asked, still not sensing her sternness. "You know you look funny when you're serious."</p><p>He could be in the mood to joke now, but she wasn't. "Let's call off the deal."</p><p>His expression dropped; she didn't know why.</p><p>"I
 think it's useless to carry on like this." She took a deep breath. "I 
admit, I was selfish for making you keep your promise to fake as my 
boyfriend. It's ridiculous now that I think about it. So childish." 
Seeing that he wasn't saying anything, Ariel continued, "You like 
Selina, right? I guess it just means that I should back off and not 
hanging onto you anymore. What would she think if she finds out our 
relationship? It's not real, but still..."</p><p>He nodded in understanding. "Yeah."</p><p>“I’m
 sorry. I must have been a big nuisance,” Ariel continued, rethinking 
all of those times she had incessantly bothered him again and again. It 
suddenly occurred to her that while she had accused him of 
insensitivity, she was no better of an example herself. Had she ever 
considered his feelings? Suddenly, Ariel felt as though she had wronged 
him all this time. Perhaps his insults were always rightfully uttered.</p><p>“I’m
 sorry that I intruded in your life and tied you up with all of these 
childish games. I know you have better things to do, but I was so 
selfish and blinded by my desire to win the challenge that I hadn’t 
asked how you feel about it. But now, I’ve decided to step back, but I 
still truly owe you this apology,” she said, her eyes staring with 
heartfelt sincerity.</p><p>“You know, for you to say something like that is very surprising,” Joe said.</p><p>“What,
 do I look unreasonable most of the time?” Ariel managed to say without 
divulging her hurtfulness. “I know my limits. I know when to back out.”</p><p>Ariel could feel him nodding his head. Then silence followed.</p><p>"Can
 I ask you a favor?" Ariel didn't know where the urge came from, but if 
she didn't ask now, she would never have the chance again. She stared at
 him hard before she spat out the next words. "Can you kiss me 
passionately?"</p><p>Seeing his hesitance, Ariel stiffened. Oh god, what
 was she doing? How could she stoop so low? Suddenly, she regretted her 
words.</p><p>“I’m sorry. I just—” Her cheeks were flushing in embarrassment.</p><p>“Do you want me to get some Midol for you or something?” Joe offered.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Cramps or bloating problems, probably?”</p><p>“No!”
 Ariel refuted, not believing the way he tried to turn the subject. Even
 though it was embarrassing, Ariel wasn’t about to let him brush off her
 so easily. “Look, I was just… it’s just that… I’m not able to see you 
anymore after this. I have no more reason to butt into your life, and I 
just…” Oh god, she was clearly spitting out rubbish!</p><p>What he did next surprised her. He had her pinned against the railings.</p><p>“You talk a lot.”</p><p>“Uh.. yeah…” She didn’t know what else to say.</p><p>“You do.”</p><p>“Need a bobby pin, then?”</p><p>“More like surgeon needles.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“It’ll be easier to stitch your mouth.”</p><p>“You will?” Ariel raised her eyebrows.</p><p>“Why not?“</p><p>“You can’t possibly do that—”</p><p>He
 captured her lips, surprising her. It was so unexpected Ariel found 
herself frozen, but it wasn’t long before the heat finally vitalized 
her. Before she knew it, she was already kissing him back. As he 
deepened the kiss, he unknowingly took her breath away. She couldn’t 
help but take notice of how tender his lips felt on hers and how his 
hand was resting on her bare shoulders.</p><p>His touch was like fuel 
poured over the flames she had been trying to suppress. All of the 
emotions she had ever felt for him--irritation, admiration, hate, 
frustration, but mostly love---burst from her heart like a volcano 
eruption. In the moment of heat and passion, the will to push him off 
was wholesomely nil.</p><p>When they broke apart, she felt breathless and had to look away, her cheeks reddening.</p><p>Oh god… What was he thinking? Sure she asked for it, but… but… she didn’t think he’d comply…</p><p>Ariel’s heart was thrashing.</p><p>It took her a moment to recover. "Remember our contract?" she asked softly.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>"I
 said that if I fall in love you with you, I'd have to suffer 
humiliation in front of the school. And if you fall in love with me, you
 have to kiss me passionately." She was watching for his reaction. "But 
now, when I asked you that, I took up your punishment instead."</p><p>Shock consumed his eyes. He must be pondering what she was trying to tell him.</p><p>"I
 don't know why I did that," Ariel muffled. "I said that the challenge 
is more important to me than kissing you, but at this point, the 
challenge is nothing to me. It was just a joke. But… kissing you now... 
is actually an entire new *meaning* for me." She looked at him, 
desperately seeking for any sign of response, but he gave none. God what
 she was doing? She was letting out more emotions than she was willing
