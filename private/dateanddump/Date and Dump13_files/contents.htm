<p class="tocn"></p><h4><!--Subtitle begin-->The Double Date<!--Subtitle end--></h4>
<!--Chapter begin-->
Ariel was quite excited at the double date with Rainie not because she 
was going to go out with Joe, but because she finally got a chance to 
see Rainie's new boyfriend, Ethan Ruan. Ever since Rainie's announcement
 of their hook-up, Ariel had to admit that she noticed how Rainie 
behaved differently. Such rare change indicated that there was something
 special about the guy and Ariel was curious to find out.<p>Ariel and 
Joe were waiting in front of the entrance of a grand amusement park. 
Fortunately for them, the park was offering discounts for people who 
went by fours. Perhaps Rainie's good luck was starting to rub off for 
everyone.</p><p>"Hey, cheer up! Stop pulling that grouchy face," Ariel scolded the disinterested Joe. He had his arms crossed, looking cool.</p><p>"I'm not pulling a grouchy face," Joe said dully, not even bothering to flick a glance. "Why do I have to agree to this?"</p><p>"You're
 my boyfriend," Ariel reminded. She had to admit that continuously 
labeling him as so was starting to become one of her habits lately. 
"It's not like this is such a bad idea, either. I mean, going out to 
have fun has got to be better than locking yourself at home, right?"</p><p>Joe mumbled something under his breath but he didn't bother to answer.</p><p>"Hey
 guys!!" Rainie finally arrived, a cheerful and happy grin shining on 
her face. Her arms were hooked with a tall, good-looking fellow that 
Ariel instantly recognized. "Did you wait long?"</p><p>"Not at all!" Ariel replied and winked. "Is this your hubby?"</p><p>Red
 shaded Rainie's cheeks as she looked over bashfully. "Ariel! Don't say 
that. We're just at the beginning of our relationship."</p><p>"Sure, 
sure," Ariel said and quickly dismissed it. She looked at Ethan with a 
deep admiration. "Heard a lot about you, there. Ethan, right? Nice to 
meet you. I'm Ariel and this is my boyfriend, Joe."</p><p>"Great to meet
 you!" Ethan boomed with his dynamic voice. His face was so bright; 
Ariel was completely taken back by his strong enthusiasm. "Oh, you don't
 know but Rainie constantly talked about you too. She keeps saying how 
lucky you are to be dating the number one school's magnet. It kind of 
makes me jealous, too," he humorously joked.</p><p>Ariel laughed. Joe gave her a weird look.</p><p>"Well,
 well, so you're Joe, right?" Ethan turned his attention to the stiff 
statue and kindly extended his hand. "Pleased to meet you."</p><p>Joe 
only shot him a blank look but his usual cold demeanor suggested that he
 bore no intention to socialize. Seeing Joe's indifference, Ariel nudged
 him to say something. Annoyed, Joe just forced out a low 'hello' to 
Ethan.</p><p>"So a man of not many words, huh?" Ethan said unnecessarily. "All the girls love that kind of guy."</p><p>Joe's disinterest had never been more evident. He looked as though he didn't even acknowledge Ethan's presence.</p><p>Rainie
 intervened conveniently. "Oh, shut up, Ethan. You talk too much. You 
know Joe has a reputation of being a cold prince. Don't force him to 
show you what it feels like to be rejected."</p><p>Ethan chuckled. "Hey, I think we can be good friends. Right Joe?"</p><p>Again, no response.</p><p>"Can
 we go in now?" Joe asked instead, directing a grimace at Ariel that 
spoke of his regret of coming. "I hope we're not just standing here to 
make conversations."</p><p>"Okay, okay." Ariel surrendered and ushered the group over to the clerk's stall.</p><p>Shortly,
 they graced the entrance of the grand amusement park and were instantly
 greeted with loud chattering and distant screams of pleasure. Both 
Ariel and Rainie could hardly contain their feelings of joy and rashly 
jumped in excitement upon witnessing the colorful cottages, beautifully 
decorated pathways, and of course, the mere sight of the roller-coaster 
rides. From an outsider’s point of view, it looked like they were little
 children who were brought to such place for the first time.</p><p>"Oh my god! It has been a year since I came to this place!" Rainie screamed exuberantly.</p><p>"We really have to have a blast today, huh?" Ariel said.</p><p>"You bet!!!"</p><p>The girls quickly stepped back to pull their partners. "So what do you guys want to go first?"</p><p>"Anything you want, baby," Ethan smiled charmingly.</p><p>Ariel stifled a giggle.</p><p>"What's wrong with you?" Joe gnarred from the side in a low whisper, sensing Ariel's unusual attention on the Ethan guy.</p><p>"Don't
 you think they fit each other perfectly? Ethan is such a hunk!" Ariel 
gushed with a hardly concealed happiness for her friend.</p><p>"He seems like an asshole to me."</p><p>"Please.
 If you ask me, you're the asshole." Ariel rolled her eyes irritably. 
Joe had never ceased to surprise her with some of his unfounded remarks.
 "Why can't you be nice for once? Always ignoring people's good 
intention. Stupid jerk."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Ariel didn't have the 
chance to answer him before buoyancy completely dominated her. She 
yanked Joe along as they followed Rainie's lead into the amusement park.
 From behind, Ariel could clearly see the spark in Rainie's eyes as she 
pinned her attention on Ethan, all the while forgetting about her best 
friend. Ariel couldn't blame her, though. A guy like Ethan was probably 
every girl's dream. He was humorous, good-looking, and eloquent with an 
admirable personality and chivalrous manners.</p><p>But Joe?</p><p>Ariel
 grumbled at the side. Well yeah, after what happened at the Christmas 
party, Joe went back to his old self again. He was stiff and cold as ice
 to her. Having him as a boyfriend made her realize it was no difference
 from possessing an empty shell.</p><p>But then again, their relationship wasn't a real one, so it didn't matter how he treated her.</p><p>For
 the next hour, Ariel managed to have fun from shooting balls, winning 
prizes, and of course enjoying the rides. Despite having a disinterested
 partner, she thought that running around the place by herself was 
pretty much worth the ticket.</p><p>"Stupid," she heard Joe mumble once. "I don't see how these things are fun."</p><p>"Maybe it's because you're a boring person?" Ariel pointed out.</p><p>"You're the child."</p><p>"Oh come on. Everyone has a childish side to him. You gotta learn how to lighten up and live life, you know?"</p><p>"Whatever. I don't care. I just wish the day will end sooner."</p><p>Suddenly
 an idea emerged in Ariel's mind as she took Joe's unhappiness into 
consideration. She knew he was dreading this event right from the start 
but the sneaky Ariel grew an urge to force Joe to change his mind.</p><p>"Hey. Since you're so bored, you want to come on a ride with me?" Ariel peered at him to see if his expression changed.</p><p>"No."</p><p>Of
 course, the stubborn prince wasn't about to give in to her request so 
easily. Days of knowing him had taught her to be more persistent toward 
his icy and unchanging attitude. "Are you sure? It'll be loads of fun! 
You can scream all you want and no one would care!!"</p><p>"Sounds pretty stupid to me."</p><p>"You know you wanna..."</p><p>"NO."</p><p>It
 didn't seem like his mind was going to budge and change. However, Ariel
 wasn't about to let his rejection affect her spirit and mood. Since 
they were here anyway, she just had to make Joe go on one ride with her 
to make it seem like a real "date" after all. So with that set in mind, 
Ariel launched forward and gripped onto Joe with a hardened 
determination. "I don't care what you say, but you're coming with ME!!!"
 And then she forcefully dragged the towering figure with her toward the
 entrance of a rollercoaster ride.</p><p>"You're definitely tall 
enough," Ariel mumbled grudgingly as she passed by the requirement sign,
 not even bothering to check for herself.</p><p>"God, you are so 
stubborn," Joe grouchily mumbled and shook her grip off, quite 
spitefully. "Fine, I'll ride. Just don't touch me."</p><p>Ariel had to 
stifle a laugh at his grim expression. "No one rides with that face." 
She pinched his cheeks in an attempt to forcefully make him smile. 
"SMILE!!"</p><p>He flashed a rather wide grin. “There, you happy?”</p><p>Ariel giggled. “Yup… See? It isn’t so bad!”</p><p>“Whatever,”
 Joe mumbled and in a quick swift motion, he yanked Ariel toward the 
entrance. “Hurry and let’s get this shit over and done with.”</p><p>Boy, talk about eager!</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>"Hmm, Rainie said to meet up at the steak house," Ariel mused out loud as they were making their way out.</p><p>"Don't tell me you don't know where it is?" It wasn't the first time Joe grumbled at her side.</p><p>"There
 it is!" Ariel then dragged the unaware Joe toward a small steakhouse in
 the corner. The sun was setting, casting its orange rays across the 
darkened sky. If Ariel didn't know better, she would think it was only 
ten minutes ago when the sun was still up and shining brightly. Time 
sure did pass by fast when she was having fun.</p><p>Shortly, the duo 
arrived inside the fully packed steak house. Strong sizzling smells 
assaulted their noses as Ariel and Joe practically crammed through in 
their haste to reach Rainie.</p><p>"Finally! We were starving!" Rainie complained as she saw the two approaching.</p><p>"Sorry.
 I didn't know where the place is," Ariel tried to explain. She cast a 
glance at Joe. "And someone was grumbling by my side."</p><p>Rainie's loud laughter rang in the air. "You guy are such a perfect couple."</p><p>"Far from it," Ariel muffled.</p><p>"If you ask me, Joe is very lucky to have Ariel." Ethan flashed Ariel a smile from across. His politeness earned a little blush,</p><p>Flattery
 sure had its way to make a girl feel bubbly all inside. Especially if 
it came from the hunk. "Thanks," Ariel said a bit shyly.</p><p>Joe 
scoffed from the side. "How come I don't feel that way?" Realizing that 
he was on the verge of spilling more details than necessary, Joe quickly
 closed his mouth and ordered his food.</p><p>Rainie was studying them though. "Come on. I can't believe you guys love to act like enemies so much. Show some love, ya?"</p><p>"Don't
 you think it makes their relationship more interesting, though?" Ethan 
commented and looked over at Ariel who only laughed it off.</p><p>"Not when you're constantly at it," Joe said.</p><p>For
 the next half hour or so, everyone was digging in their food to feast 
their hunger from the tiring and exciting day. While Joe ate silently to
 himself, the threesome engaged in loud chatter, laughing and joking as 
though they hadn't done so in ages. Joe was getting pretty annoyed but 
decided to suppress his discontent. He already suffered half the day by 
being here. How hard could it be to endure their nonsense for a little 
while longer?</p><p>"Ah, I think we're leaving someone out," Ethan pointed out after awhile, glancing at Joe.</p><p>"Right! How could you do that, Ariel?" Rainie remarked but she was as unaware as everyone else.</p><p>Ariel
 suddenly felt a little guilty. Even though she disliked Joe and his 
crude comments, she knew it wasn't right to purposely ignore him, but 
then again, maybe that was what he really wanted. "Don't worry about 
him, guys. I'm sure he's having a great time to himself."</p><p>"Yeah," Joe said. "You all proceed. I don't mind."</p><p>"Aww, he's so generous!" Rainie squealed and nudged Ethan. "See? You should be like him sometimes."</p><p>"Yeah."
 Ethan tossed Joe a look as he dabbed a napkin at his lips. "I also 
should ask Joe for tips on how to start and maintain a relationship."</p><p>Joe
 stared at him, contemplating the words and amusement suddenly lit his 
eyes. It seemed like Ethan felt fishy or something about his 
relationship with Ariel.</p><p>"Come on, people. Stop chatting and eat!" Ariel reprimanded for everyone to finish.</p><p>"Ah,
 I'm full!" Rainie announced forty minutes later and leaned back against
 the chair, rubbing her round tummy as a burp threatened to erupt in her
 throat. She held it back though, and laughed. "I need to go to the 
restroom."</p><p>"Go ahead then, baby," Ethan said. "I'll wait for you."</p><p>She gave him a quick peck and left.</p><p>"I should pay the bills," Ethan announced after a while. "It'll be my treat."</p><p>For
 some reason, whenever people took the initiative to pay like that, 
Ariel was exhorted to suggest otherwise. "No, no! Let us pay. It was my 
idea after all to hold the double date. It'll be weird if I make you pay
 when I invited you."</p><p>Ethan chuckled. "Don't worry about it. It was my pleasure to meet you two."</p><p>"You're too kind. But I still insist."</p><p>"Come on. Don't fight with me over this."</p><p>Ariel's persistence crystalized. "Oh, you shouldn't say that. Now I definitely won't make you pay."</p><p>"God,
 you two aren't going to give in, are you?" Joe spoke up with a 
refreshing bluntness, patience dropping at the sight. "Forget it. I'll 
take the liberty to pay. And don't argue with me." With that, Joe got up
 from his seat and sauntered away.</p><p>Ariel and Ethan exchanged a laugh.</p><p>"Don't
 worry. His family's rich anyway. I guess it's fair to make him pay," 
Ariel said. Not to mention, he was the one that pulled her down to the 
moody pit with him. It was only right to make him compensate for her 
moment of grief.</p><p>"Mmm." Ethan tapped a finger on the table. The 
music was blaring in the background and the atmosphere was chaotic.  
"It's kind of too stuffy in here. You want to head out first?"</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>The
 raw fresh air whipped against their faces as they exited the steak 
house. By now the sun had completely settled down and darkness conquered
 the sky. The cool breeze glazed their skin, sending goosebumps to trail
 down their spines.</p><p>"So did you have fun?" Ethan asked in an attempt to trigger a conversation. He turned his attention on Ariel.</p><p>"Yup."
 Ariel replied honestly, forgetting the little bickering she had with 
Joe throughout the day. She couldn't blame on him entirely though. She 
could see effort on his part to make the experience a little less than 
painful, and it did pay off because spending time with him wasn't as bad
 as she'd imagined. "And you? Did Rainie bother you a lot?"</p><p>His booming voice exploded in a little laughter. "She's a perky girl. One can find a lot of happiness with her."</p><p>"Yeah. But I admire you for putting up with her crazy antics."</p><p>When she said that, she didn't expect a shocking reply. "I admire Joe."</p><p>It was so unexpected that Ariel's mind failed to respond. "What do you mean?"</p><p>Here, he shot her a very, very intense stare. "I mean, he's lucky to have a wonderful partner."</p><p>By
 now, the conversation was stirring the way Ariel never thought it 
would. Confusion drew her eyebrows together as she plunged in 
speculation. "I don't exactly get where you're going."</p><p>Ethan smiled darkly. "You can't see it? I really admire you a lot too, Ariel."</p><p>She quickly looked away. This was too much of a shock. "I-I'm with Joe."</p><p>"But I can see that your relationship isn’t real," he surprised her with his sharp observation.</p><p>"But
 you have Rainie!" Ariel sputtered frantically, feeling her heart about 
to break through the cage. She was too flustered with her own emotions 
to detect the smirk on Ethan's face. "You guys are in a relationship!" </p><p>"I know."</p><p>The
 way he said it caught Ariel's attention. He was very aware of the the 
hole he was digging himself in, yet why did he persist? Comprehension 
began to knock on the door to her brain. "Don't you like her?"</p><p>"She's a nice girl, but there's no hard feeling about it."</p><p>Ariel's concern now peaked. "Then why did you go out with her?"</p><p>"Why did you go out with Joe?"</p><p>The
 question thew Ariel off-guard. When she glanced back at Ethan, she 
could see that his eyes were full of apprehension as though he could 
read through her like a book. She had to admit, his good looks made her 
heart flutter more than she was bargaining for, but Ariel knew better 
than to fall in the trap. Yet, she would never thought that this 
conversation would take place so unexpectedly. What would Rainie think?!</p><p>"That's
 none of your business," Ariel icily said and sent her gaze elsewhere to
 avoid his interrogating eyes. "You know I'm Rainie's best friend. You 
better not do anything to harm her."</p><p>"You are aware that it's useless to say that now," Ethan said.</p><p>Ariel gulped as she saw his advancing movements. "What do you mean?"</p><p>"Because
 you've attracted me and now I'm sure I want you instead of her." His 
directness made her heart and mind pumping crazily in an unusual rhythm.
 He had appeared so gentlemanly toward her but now, all the rubbish he 
was saying was starting to convince her otherwise.</p><p>"What are you doing?" Ariel shot protectively as she realized their close proximity.</p><p>"Come
 on. You know you're attracted to me. If you're shy, I'll help you and 
take the initiative to ask you out," Ethan said. "What do you think, 
baby?"</p><p>"Get away from me!" Ariel screamed, but she knew that no one would hear them.</p><p>In a moment, Ethan had her pinned against the wall. "Shhh. You'll drag unnecessary attention."</p><p>Ariel's
 mind blanked out, not knowing what to do at this point. Hell, she had 
never shared such close intimacy with guy before, not even Mike, and 
such sudden confession had already stirred her mind into confusion. Her 
nerves were shaky and Ariel couldn't even form coherent thoughts. She 
squirmed more when she realized he was inching closer... and closer...</p><p>BAM!!!</p><p>Ariel fluttered her eyes open in time to see Ethan stumbling backwards, a hand on his cheek.</p><p>Relief exploded in her chest as Ariel turned her eyes to a stoically posed Joe.</p><p>"What do you think you're doing?" Ethan shouted angrily, feeling the blood at the side of his mouth.</p><p>"I should ask you that question." Joe's stare was frosty.</p><p>Ethan
 was about to say something when Rainie's voice boomed by his ears. 
"YOU!!" She screamed, too flustered for words. "I... I never..."</p><p>It was as though Rainie's appearance broke a spell, and Ethan finally snapped to reality. "Look, baby--"</p><p>"Don't ever speak to me again!!" Rainie blared hurtfully and dashed off.</p><p>The
 annoyance on Ethan's face was clearly visible as well as the fact that 
he didn't want to chase after her. However, when he glanced back and Joe
 and Ariel, brains told him to leave as he conceded to defeat. Ethan 
shot Ariel a last look before reluctantly pursuing after Rainie.</p><p>"I can't believe what he's just done!" Ariel fumed.</p><p>Joe scoffed. "What did I tell you? He's an asshole."</p><p>"How did you know?"</p><p>Joe was beginning to walk away. "I've seen him around with a couple of girls."</p><p>"And you didn't say anything? Look what you've done! Rainie will be hurt!"</p><p>Joe rolled his eyes detestably. "I can't help that you girls are so stupid."</p><p>"You..." Ariel felt her temper rising at his insensitivity at insults.</p><p>"Come on. Let's go home."</p><p>"No! I have to wait here until Rainie gets back." Ariel folded her arms stubbornly.</p><p>"You
 think she will?" Joe rose an eyebrow. "She'll probably need time to 
herself. You waiting here isn't going to help the situation."</p><p>Ariel
 knew he was right. Knowing her friend, Rainie would dash off somewhere 
secretly and lash out her anger and frustration. Although she could tell
 that this was Rainie's somewhat first love, Ariel was aware that Rainie
 was never that serious with relationships in the first place. It might 
take her days to cool off, but it wouldn't take an eternity to mend her 
forever changing heart.</p><p>Silence engulfed the air as Ariel trailed a
 few steps behind him. Her mind replayed what just happened. The way 
Ethan was inching closer toward her... God, what a heart-torturing 
experience. Sure, she thought he was a cool guy, but that didn't mean he
 had the right to advance on her. The mere thought of his face made her 
blood boil suddenly.</p><p>Then, she cast her eyes to Joe. She hadn't realized before but now, she remembered what he did.</p><p>"Hey..." Ariel called after him. "Why did you help me?"</p><p>"I don't just stand by when I see something bad's going on."</p><p>"Yeah... but you didn't have to punch Ethan that hard, you know."</p><p>Joe shrugged. "Remember the contract? It says I have to protect you, so I guess the urge just came."</p><p>Ariel almost forgot about that. "Oh..." Seeing how he remembered it made her blush a little. "Well... Thanks."</p><p>"Don't thank me. I'm bound to your contract, remember?" With that, Joe hastened his pace.</p><p>Ariel
 smirked. The guy was just adamant about hiding his emotions, wasn't he?
 Sure, she knew that he only helped her out of a obligation but the way 
his eyes flashed with concern and worriment didn't go unnoticed by her. 
He may not want to admit, but she did indeed have him figured out more 
than he thought.</p><p>Ariel quickly snapped back to reality when she saw the distance between them widening.</p><p>"Wei,
 Mister! Wait up!" However, in her haste to reach him, Ariel’s foot lost
 its stance as she clumsily tripped over a rock. The abruptness of it 
all sent Ariel tumbling forward toward the ground. Instinctually, she 
shut her eyes, ready to face the pain when a pair of arms wrapped 
themselves smoothly around her waist, successfully preventing her from a
 disastrous fall.</p><p>Gasping tightly, Ariel felt her body froze upon 
their body contact, his warm touch sending her heart thrashing rapidly. 
Time seemed to have stopped as they lingered in each other’s eyes, the 
tension between them heavy like a lead weight.</p><p>“Erm… thanks,” 
Ariel didn’t know what else to say as she felt her body tensing. Oh god,
 the fact that their faces were only inches apart was a contribution to 
her fluttering mind. Oh no, he was inching closer. What was he 
thinking?! Ariel couldn’t help but let her mind plunged into the gutter.</p><p>But it was just a false alarm.</p><p>“You’re stupid enough to be attracted to Ethan, but I didn’t know you were clumsy too,” Joe said, his eyes peering down at her.</p><p>“I am not clumsy!!!” she refuted.</p><p>“I tend to dislike people who deny things that are so obvious.”</p><p>A smirk crept up on her lips as Ariel shot him a look. “Well, it’s pretty obvious that someone was jealous!” she teased.</p><p>“Over a bonehead like you? Don’t flatter yourself.”</p><p>Arg.
 His comments always had a way to put a dent in her mood. “If I bother 
you so much, you didn’t have to help me! Release me at once!” she 
commanded.</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>God, when she rashly spat that out, Ariel
 wasn’t expecting that he’d abide to it. Before her nerves could react, 
she already felt him withdrawing his arms. The sudden lack of support 
made her gasp out in surprise as gravity forcefully yanked her down. In 
no time, her bum had painfully connected to the hard pavement ground.</p><p>Ouch.</p><p>Rubbing
 her bum, Ariel stared in shock at Joe’s retreating figure. He could act
 warm at one time, but cold and mean at others. Sometimes, it was so 
hard to decipher his actions, but despite the way he treated her, Ariel 
held onto the thought that he did really care for her.</p><p>‘Think you can fool me by acting cool?’ Ariel thought. ‘I’m not an idiot!’ And she stuck her tongue out at his back.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>First
 of all, *ducks tomatoes* Sorry for making Ethan the bad guy, lol, but 
yes we had to do that ^_~ He's a guest star, so after this, he's gone. 
lol</p><p>Sadly, this is our last update before school starts again 
(@#$@#!!! -.-;), but hope it wasn't disappointing ya. Originally, the 
chapter wasn't supposed to be updated today since it needs revision but 
you readers are too, too lovable!! </p><p>Let us know your thoughts! We would love to hear your feedback!!</p><p>Thank you all!! We are truly and deeply grateful for your support!!! </p><p>&lt;3 Nhu
