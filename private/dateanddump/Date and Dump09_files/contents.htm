<p class="tocn"></p><h4><!--Subtitle begin-->Live the Drama, Babe.<!--Subtitle end--></h4>
<!--Chapter begin-->
"I can't believe I agreed to do this," Joe grumbled from behind.<p> </p><p>Ariel
 whipped on her heels in time to see the displeasure written on his 
face. True, she was still surprised at how he could just impulsively 
claim to be her boyfriend in front of Mike and Hebe. She was 
outrageously furious at first, but considering it now, she knew she owed
 him her gratitude for the help.</p><p> </p><p>"Come on. Pick up your speed!" Ariel gestured for him to hasten. "Rainie and Gillian are waiting."</p><p> </p><p>"I
 don't get why we have to put up a show for them." Joe's eyes dulled 
with disinterest. "Can't you just tell them we're together?"</p><p> </p><p>"No," Ariel supplied. "Rainie will not believe unless she sees it with her own eyes."</p><p> </p><p>"This is ridiculous," Joe said. "You girls really have nothing else to do."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 paused as she positioned her hands on her hips, staring at Joe with an 
irritated look. "Are you telling me that you want to back out now? 
Remember, I didn't force you to do this. You voluntarily claimed me as 
your girlfriend!"</p><p> </p><p>He rolled his eyes. "I know. An act I horribly regret."</p><p> </p><p>Even
 though he didn't say it out loud, Ariel could discern the embarrassment
 he was feeling. The fact that he was so against the idea of going out 
with her was definitely stabbing, to say the least.  "I will not 
tolerate your blunt attitude. If you have nothing nice to say, I suggest
 you keep your mouth shut. No matter how much you are displeased, we are
 still going to carry out our plans."</p><p> </p><p>Joe reluctantly 
obeyed, much to Ariel's surprise. Maybe she was thinking too much, but 
did she see a glimmer of guilt in his eyes? Did he agree out of a 
obligatory desire to help? He did insult her pretty badly after all 
without a good reason. It wasn't too much to ask that he rectify the 
situation that needed rectification.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie and Gillian 
were practically dropping their jaws when Ariel made her grand entrance 
to the cafeteria with the cold prince. She could feel the simmering 
satisfaction as they trode over to the fourth table where her friends 
were stiffly perched in their seats.</p><p> </p><p>"You can't be 
serious," Rainie murmured in absolute shock. She managed to pinch 
herself a couple of times to assure this was no nightmare.</p><p> </p><p>Gillian
 tilted her glasses like always, studying with a keen eye. But no matter
 how smart she was, Ariel knew that Gillian wouldn't be able to figure 
out sentimental matters even if her life depended on it. "This is 
definitely shocking, but I am happy for you, Ariel."</p><p> </p><p>Rainie's eyes bulged. "How about me?! This means I lose! L-O-S-E!"</p><p> </p><p>Gillian stifled a giggle. "Rainie... You should have known that losing is part of the game."</p><p> </p><p>"I
 know! But I was SO sure that Ariel will lose!" Now, Rainie was just a 
panicky mess. For a split second, Ariel almost felt sorry for her friend
 but quickly suppressed the feeling. What was the point of all her 
suffering and endless frets if she couldn't see this outcome?</p><p> </p><p>A smirk swept Ariel's face. "Rainie, Rainie, who is the master of all bets now?"</p><p> </p><p>"Please! Our dateline isn't over yet!" Rainie protested. "Let's see if you guys last..."</p><p> </p><p>Now, it was Ariel's turn to be surprised. "Wait, what? You mean we have to drag this on for two months in a half?"</p><p> </p><p>Rainie's
 trademark grin surfaced. "Of course. You didn't think it was so easy, 
did you? For all I know, you two can be acting right now. I will NOT 
lose until you two prove that you are truly in love."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel and Joe exchanged glances. Joe looked unpleasantly disgruntled.</p><p> </p><p>"This
 is unfair," Ariel voiced out heatedly. "You only specify that we need 
to date. There isn't any rule that says sentimental feelings be 
involved. You are ridiculously expecting too much!"</p><p> </p><p>"Fine!!!"
 Rainie too knew that was a bit far-fetched. "But you two must surpass 
the dateline in order for me to be convinced that you're truly dating."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel rolled her eyes. "Fine. That'll be easy."</p><p> </p><p>Rainie snickered. "Not unless if you two are faking it."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 was quick to defend. "Of course not! I'll show you that we are a golden
 couple. Not only will we make it through the next two months, we might 
surpass SIX months and beyond that!!"</p><p> </p><p>This earned an 
incredulous look from Joe who looked like he wanted to strangle her 
until she dropped dead at her feet. Ariel secretly gave him a nudge from
 under the table for him to play along.</p><p> </p><p>Gillian looked ultimately surprised. "Wow, I never knew you were so ambitious. You two must really be serious with each other."</p><p> </p><p>"Of course," Ariel winked to Joe.</p><p> </p><p>He grumbled more.</p><p> </p><p>"Why doesn't your boyfriend say anything?" Rainie suspiciously asked. "Yo!"</p><p> </p><p>Joe rolled his eyes. "Is there anything for me to say? I'm not interested in your girl talk."</p><p> </p><p>Rainie
 was quite taken back by his cold attitude. "Wei!" she banged her hand 
against the table. "I am after all your girlfriend's friend!"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 quickly intervened, seeing that Joe was too annoyed to reply. "Relax, 
Rainie. You know how he is. He isn't crowned as the cold prince for 
nothing."</p><p> </p><p>At this, Rainie retreated as she plunged in deep
 thought. "You're right..." she said, casting a glance at Joe. "Well, 
that's okay. I'm a very generous person." Her eyes never left Joe when 
she began talking to him. Sure, she heard a lot about the school's 
magnet, but to closely view him was actually quite an interesting 
experience. "You're too lucky, Ariel. Thanks to me, you got your chance 
to snatch your prince in shining armor. I'm sure Mike will be jealous as
 hell..."</p><p> </p><p>At the mention of her ex, Ariel felt her stomach
 do the funny flip. She gulped. Even though she successfully got her 
revenge, a feeling of unease had always settled inside her...</p><p> </p><p>"Speaking of him, why isn't he coming?" Rainie mused out loud.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel's eyes shot wide open. "What? You invited him?!"</p><p> </p><p>"Of
 course!" Her friend replied enthusiastically. "As your best friend, I 
took the liberty to invite him over so that he can see how much you are 
better off without him! Isn't that what you want?"</p><p> </p><p>Too bad
 Rainie didn't consider the possibility that perhaps Mike had already 
known... AND seen them together already. Ariel hadn't notify her friends
 of the meeting yet. Now it was too late. Even if she said it out loud, 
there was no way change things now.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel slapped a hand 
to her foreward, and groaned inwardly. Meeting Mike for the second time 
only meant more awkwardness and discomfort.</p><p> </p><p>"What's the matter?" Gillian asked. "Are you still uncomfortable to see him?"</p><p> </p><p>"Don't worry!" Rainie interjected. "I'm sure he's the one that will be burning in unease. Ha-ha!"</p><p> </p><p>"I'm
 leaving." All eyes darted to Joe, who had been silent for awhile. He 
clearly looked bothered and everyone could see how much his muscles were
 budging to make the leave. "I can't believe you girls are shallow 
enough to come up with all these plans just for a guy."</p><p> </p><p>Rainie
 arched her eyebrows. Joe's cantankerous attitude didn't go unnoticed by
 her sharp scrutinizing eyes. It was true that he may be an ice person, 
but was this the way one act toward his girlfriend? If she wasn't wrong,
 Joe didn't even seem a bit happy to be here.</p><p> </p><p>"Wei! What 
do you think you're doing?" Rainie snapped coarsely. Her exaggerated 
actions earned a few looks from their neighbors and Ariel felt 
embarrassment crawling to burn her cheeks. "How can you leave your 
girlfriend like that? Are you not a man?"</p><p> </p><p>Joe cast a 
glance at Ariel. "I figure I did enough for you last time and I've tried
 my best to tolerate you girl's stupidity. There is no need to carry on.
 They're your friends so they should understand." He was getting ready 
to leave. "Unlike you all, I have better things to do."</p><p> </p><p>Rainie stared in utter surprise. "Wait... You mean that you two were really faking it?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel's
 face was flushing. She couldn't stand how he could publicly announce it
 out loud. It was no difference from humiliating her! Pride wouldn't let
 her keep her mouth shut. "If you were so appalled at this arrangement, 
maybe you could have considered the choice of telling me earlier! I 
don't need you to pity me! I don't need your help!"</p><p> </p><p>"You said so," Joe stared coldly.</p><p> </p><p>"So
 it was all fake, wasn't it?" To Ariel's utmost horror, Mike made his 
grand entrance. There was an underlying triumphant spark under his 
expression that Ariel detested. Joe seemed to have an 'oh-no' expression
 on his face while every one else looked with dread. "I knew there was 
something fishy. Ariel, you did so much just for me?"</p><p> </p><p>He was clearly mocking her to his enjoyment. Ariel found herself stumped and speechless. She was not prepared for this yet.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm
 really honored. I really am," Mike said, smiling. Ariel detected a kind
 of gladness in him, but she wasn't sure. Wait, why would he? If 
anything, he'd be glad that he still had that sort of influence on her. 
Something Ariel didn't appreciate.</p><p> </p><p>"Don't flatter 
yourself, lover boy," Rainie hissed in defense of her friend. "She going
 out with Joe has absolutely nothing to do with you."</p><p> </p><p>"I 
hope not. Because it would break my heart to know that I'd been hurting 
my girlfriend all this time," Mike said with suaveness, but from his 
tone, everyone knew he didn't mean it.</p><p> </p><p>"Ex-girlfriend," Ariel corrected with a tinge of irritation.</p><p> </p><p>"That
 is if only you really want that," Mike said, nearing towards her. He 
trapped her against a wall, eying her with intensity. Everyone was 
baffled at his words. What did he mean by that?</p><p> </p><p>Ariel too 
was befuddled like a lost puppy. "What are you saying? You still have 
Hebe, remember? Don't you even think about cheating on her--"</p><p> </p><p>"Look
 Ariel. There's this thing I've wanted to tell you about..." Mike said. 
All of the sudden, his taunting tone and mock vanished and what replaced
 them was a simple sincerity, something that astonished Ariel. What was 
he talking about? Ariel was too flabbergasted by all the possible ideas 
running through her head as he inched closer. "I'm really sorry for what
 I did, I really am. I'm sorry for being a jerk, but I had no choice--"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 pushed him away, aware of his intention. Did he want to mend things 
with her when Hebe was not present? If there was anything that he proved
 to her, he proved that he was indeed a cheating bastard. "I don't want 
to hear it."</p><p> </p><p>"No, Ariel. Listen. I really didn't want to go out with--"</p><p> </p><p>"Shut up!"</p><p> </p><p>What
 was this all about? What was he trying to do? Wasn't he enjoying 
himself at deriding and making fun of her just a moment ago? Why the 
sudden change? She remembered the other day when she met him; the way he
 had looked at her with infuriation when he thought she was going out 
with Joe. What was that all about?</p><p> </p><p>She knew his 
personality pretty well. He was pretty contradictory, the type who likes
 to bully the girls he liked. It happened that way when he was courting 
her, always shooting biting teases. Mike wasn't very bright when it came
 to sentimental things, especially towards love. He didn't know that she
 liked him until the minute before they started going out.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, a possibility dawned upon her.</p><p> </p><p>Could Mike still harbor some feelings for her?</p><p> </p><p>"Ariel, I swear, I really didn't want to break up with you. It's just that..."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 gazed at Mike, who seemed so eager to explain his story. How many times
 had she wished for this scene to happen in the past few months? How 
many times had she pined for him in his absence? How many tears had she 
cried, and how many pains had she endured seeing him with his new 
girlfriend?</p><p> </p><p>But now Ariel realized that this wasn't what she wanted anymore.</p><p> </p><p>"Stop,"
 Ariel said, interrupting him. "I don't want to hear what you have to 
say. It's over, Mike. It has been over since three months ago."</p><p> </p><p>Mike paused short. They were so close that she could hear his shallow breathing. "You still have feelings for me, don't you?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel looked away. She knew she couldn't lie. "Yes."</p><p> </p><p>A light gleamed in his face.</p><p> </p><p>"But it's too late, Mike." Ariel turned to face him. "You have Hebe now."</p><p> </p><p>"Listen,
 I didn't know why I was so stupid to break us up for her. But why 
didn't you say anything? Why didn't you stop me? I thought it was what 
you wanted since you already found out about it."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel 
glared hard at him. "You were the one who said you didn't love me 
anymore! You cheated on me! What could I do?" She hated the way he 
blamed everything on her. "You made us this way!"</p><p> </p><p>"But you
 could have said something!" Mike hissed, but knowing that his voice was
 slightly too loud, he immediately showed regret. "I... I was drunk that
 night. Hebe and I... I just couldn't abandon her after that, you know? 
She's, after all, a friend of mine. I couldn't hurt her so I--"</p><p> </p><p>"So
 you decided to hurt me!" Ariel finished for him, pushing him away from 
her. Everybody was looking with much apprehension but Ariel didn't care 
about the attention she was getting. She couldn't accept the fact that 
her boyfriend put her feelings below everything else. He considered her 
even less than a friend! The revelation was too painful to absorb. 
"Listen, Mr. He! We have absolutely no relation from today onwards!"</p><p> </p><p>"Ariel!"</p><p> </p><p>"Don't
 call my name!" Ariel bellowed feverishly. "You're really despicable you
 know that? Hebe isn't here so you decided to tell me all of these 
things? For what? To get back with me? You stupid cheating bastard!"</p><p> </p><p>"Go
 Ariel!" Rainie cheered. Then, she turned towards Mike with a deriding 
look. "You don't deserve her, bastard! Leave her alone, you already got a
 girlfriend!"</p><p> </p><p>Mike ignored the biting remark. "I'm sorry I
 didn't make it clear to you earlier. I was out of my mind. I really 
wanted to get back with you, but I thought you were over me--"</p><p> </p><p>"I AM over you," Ariel clarified.</p><p> </p><p>Mike was stumped.</p><p> </p><p>Joe smirked from the side. "Time to retreat in defeat, Two-timer," he icily suggested.</p><p> </p><p>Pride
 wounded and publicly embarrassed, Mike turned an angry red. He turned 
towards Joe with a murderous look. "Stay out of my business! What was 
your motive in trying to be Ariel's fake boyfriend, huh?"</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 was seemingly vexed but he didn't bother to reply. His snobby 
indifference only angered Mike more. With the intention to blast the 
arrogant jerk to hell, Mike sauntered over towards Joe and grabbed his 
collar. "You think you're so great? You're nothing but a lonely pile of 
feces to me with a rotten personality. Girls who swoon over you 
obviously are visibly challenged."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel immediately 
stomped towards the two and pushed Mike away, getting in between them. 
Mike's insult was far too rude and harsh for Ariel to accept. She had 
the urge to defend Joe. "Wei! Watch your mouth. I know you're jealous, 
but you do not have to spit out such rubbish to humiliate yourself. Joe 
is a great person, smarter than you with a personality 100 times better 
than yours! If anyone's a pile of feces, it's you, you cheating crap!"</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 glanced at her, a bit taken aback by her strong defense and endless 
praises. Since when was she so fond of him? He was puzzled, but 
nonetheless he didn't like the way she spoke as though she knew him or 
the way she tried to help him. Did he appear like a weakling to her?</p><p> </p><p>Mike
 was baffled at Ariel's speech. He wasn't aware that she was so close to
 that Joe Cheng. "You've got to be kidding me comparing me to him."</p><p> </p><p>"Actually
 you're right. You're such a low life that you don't even compare to 
him!" Ariel crossed her arms. Now she wondered why she ever pined for a 
bastard like him. How did she fall in love with him in the first place?!
 She must have been blind indeed.</p><p> </p><p>"You'll regret this, Ariel Lin. I gave you a chance," Mike snarled.</p><p> </p><p>"I am glad to not take that stupid chance! Going out with you was my biggest regret!”</p><p> </p><p>"Oh,
 don't humor me, Ariel. Your biggest regret will be him, just you 
watch." Mike chucked them denigrating glares before taking off.</p><p> </p><p>The tension immediately eased as if the air had been cleaned. Ariel sucked in a breath. "Oh my god. What drama," she muttered.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie
 clapped aloud. "Bravo! Bravo! That was amazing!" She chirped, loving 
the entertainment show just broadcasted. "I knew I could count on you to
 brighten up my days."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel frowned as she approached her
 friend. "You're shrilling now?! If it wasn't because of you, none of 
this would ever happen!"</p><p> </p><p>"Hey... I made you see Mike's 
real personality, didn't I? Otherwise, you'd still pine for him." Rainie
 giggled. "And hey, I also match made you with a prince, didn't I? 
Instead of yelling at me, I think you should prepare me a big thank-you 
party."</p><p> </p><p>Joe's classical annoyed expression surfaced again 
as he tossed his hands into his pockets. "Don't say rubbish. Didn't I 
clarify the matter already?"</p><p> </p><p>"Joe!!!!" Suddenly, someone's
 deafening scream shattered through the perfect peace. At the entrance, 
Jolin Tsai was storming down the pathway with her clicking heels. She 
appeared angry with her dragon appearance.</p><p> </p><p>Joe seemed to have a dreadful look on his face, probably knowing that another drama was coming.</p><p> </p><p>"I heard that you're going out with this airhead, is it true?" Jolin asked.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 watched Joe. Somehow, inside, she was wishing he'd say yes. It was a 
stupid wish and she even cursed herself for having such thought. Joe 
would never admit to that.</p><p> </p><p>"Answer me, Joe! Please tell me no!" Jolin cried, tugging on his arm. "You can't do this to me."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 almost felt pitiful for Jolin. Right now, she finally knew how pathetic
 it was to pine for someone who didn't really love you. From what just 
happened, Ariel could already conclude that her relationship with Mike 
had never been based on true love. Mike was just possessive by nature, 
instantly wanting to mend back with her once he learned she still had 
feelings for him. In a way, she could connect with Jolin and wished that
 there was something she could do.</p><p> </p><p>"Jolin, let me go," Joe said irritably as he pulled his arm away.</p><p> </p><p>"Please
 tell me, Joe. You have never gone out with anyone before; you can't do 
this!" Jolin was almost close to tears. Perhaps, she had always admired 
Joe for forever staying single and now she just couldn't accept anything
 to ruin her image of Joe.</p><p> </p><p>"Who I go out with isn't your 
concern," Joe said coldly. "Look Jolin; I only think of you as a sister.
 Please don't make it harder than it is."</p><p> </p><p>Jolin clasped a 
hand to her mouth as the tears finally spilled. Joe had never told her 
to go away like this. True that he had always demonstrated his 
irritation with her, but he made clear that their relationship was 
different than from the other girls' by not rejecting her willingness 
towards him. But now, he was clearly setting the lines between them as a
 brotherly and sisterly relationship--something that Jolin found 
immensely hard to accept at this point. "Joe, you can't do this," she 
sobbed. "I've been with you for a year now. You just can't break it off 
with me like this!"</p><p> </p><p>"We've never gone out," Joe said, 
still maintaining his composure. "I never rejected you the way I did 
with the other girls because I considered you as a friend. Time has made
 me treasure you like a sister. But now, if you persist like this, then 
I'm afraid we can't even be casual acquaintances."</p><p> </p><p>Jolin gazed at him with wet eyes, not believing his words."Is it... Is it because of her?"</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 gazed at the puzzled Ariel for a second. For a very unknown reason, Joe
 approached Ariel and threw his arms on her shoulders. "Yes. As you 
said, we are going out. I hope that you don't have any wishful thinking 
towards me anymore."</p><p> </p><p>Jolin was utterly defeated. She could
 not do anything but let the tears continue to flow down her cheeks like
 endless paths as she hurriedly dashed out of the room with humiliation 
and pain.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel looked up to Joe, completely astonished by what just happened. Even Rainie and Gillian could not believe their eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Joe released Ariel, looking tired and exhausted. Without saying another word, he walked away.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel didn't know why, but she was compelled to chase after him.</p><p> </p><p>"Wei, where you are going?"</p><p> </p><p>"Class."</p><p> </p><p>"But we have another five minutes or so."</p><p> </p><p>Joe rolled his eyes. "Is there a rule that says you can't come to class early?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 kept silent as they walked down the path. He was clearly flabbergasted.
 Could it be because of Jolin? "Umm... I was wondering... Well... Back 
there...." Ariel stammered, not knowing how to phrase her thoughts. She 
was curious as to why he made things so heartbreaking for Jolin.</p><p> </p><p>"I just feel like she needs a closure," Joe replied much to Ariel's surprise. How could he know what she was thinking?</p><p> </p><p>"Huh?"</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 glanced down at her, but he continued walking. "She's been by my side 
ever since I arrived here. She's always had this hope towards me that 
we'd be an item one day. It's sort of my fault actually. With me 
endlessly rejecting girls that hope grew day by day. I don't have any 
feelings for her but I didn't have the courage to break her heart the 
way I did with the other girls, for some very odd reason. I owed her 
this closure."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel observed him. She didn't know that he
 was capable of thinking for other people with his I-don't-give-a-damn 
attitude, and so she was more than pleasantly surprised. "But you didn't
 have to use me..."</p><p> </p><p>"Isn't that what you wanted? For that stupid challenge?”</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 bit her lips. "That is the least of my concern right now." He didn’t 
answer her, so she propped up a different topic. “Um, about Mike… Sorry 
about that.”</p><p> </p><p>He glanced at her strangely. “Why?”</p><p> </p><p>“I know you didn’t deserve that bashing… It’s all my fault. I’m sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>“Stupid… you weren’t the one who said those things. But thanks for defending me back there.”</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 looked at him, sort of surprised that he said such polite words. “Oh… 
you’re welcome. He was slandering you. Of course I had to do that.”</p><p> </p><p>Joe appeared annoyed again. “But don’t do that again. I’m not a weakling. I can speak up for myself.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh…” Ariel said disappointedly, biting her lips. Silence fell again.</p><p> </p><p>"You really think Jolin will accept that?" Ariel asked another question.</p><p> </p><p>He was quiet for awhile. "I don't know. Only time will tell."</p><p> </p><p>"You
 know, this is the first time I see you so gentle with someone... Does 
Jolin have a place in your heart somewhere?" Ariel immediately regretted
 blurting out such a random question.</p><p> </p><p>Joe smirked at her as he stopped in his tracks, making Ariel bewildered. He turned to face her. "Are you jealous?" he asked.</p><p> </p><p>"What?!" Ariel widened her eyes. "Puh lease! I don't even like you!"</p><p> </p><p>"Oh
 yeah? What's with the endless praises earlier? Someone clearly said I 
was a great person with a great personality." He taunted her.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel sputtered. "I’m your friend. Why can’t I say those things?” She said defensively.</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 laughed. If she wasn't correct, that was probably the first time she 
had ever heard him laughed. Ariel was completely astounded. "Why are you
 so anxious about it? Don't worry. Even if you like me, I would never 
ever fall in love with you."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel glared at him. "Wei! Don't make yourself so high! I would be the one who would never ever fall in love with you!"</p><p> </p><p>"Don't say things you're not sure of," Joe teased.</p><p> </p><p>"Arg! I take back what I said! You have a rotten personality!" Ariel hissed.</p><p> </p><p>"You can't take things back."</p><p> </p><p>"Yes I can! Come back here!"</p><p> </p><p>"Catch me if you can!"</p><p> </p><p>"That's not fair. You have long legs!"</p><p> </p><p>"What? Are you jealous of what God gave me too?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 fumed when he made faces at her. "You rotten pig! Oh my god! I must 
have been out of my mind saying those things about you! Come back here!"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 couldn’t contain a strange happiness inside of her. She had taken 
notice that he did not reject her when she claimed that she was his 
friend. Although the change was subtle, Ariel knew that it was a huge 
progress.</p><p> </p><p>Like two imbecilic kids, the two teens were racing down the hallway, thrusting verbal fireballs and teases.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>So
 much happened in this chapter, but as you can see, Joe has declared 
himself "official" with Ariel once again. This will not be the last 
you'll see of Mike or Jolin unfortunately. The next chapter is very 
long. We will probably update it on Wednesday; do stay tuned!!!</p><p>Your comments will definitely be appreciated! Thank you for reading and supporting, everyone!! :]</p><p>&lt;3 Bunny Ears
