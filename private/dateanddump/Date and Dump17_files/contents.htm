</p><p class="tocn"></p><h3>Chapter 17</h3>
<p class="tocn"></p><h4><!--Subtitle begin-->The Meaning Behind a Kiss<!--Subtitle end--></h4>
<!--Chapter begin-->
Ariel sat against the tree, her face devoid of emotions. She appeared 
almost like a lifeless doll, the doors to her soul completely locked. 
The only difference was that she was actually breathing.<p> </p><p>Rainie
 and Gillian studied their friend, concerned. It had been three days and
 Ariel hadn't returned to normal. They had bugged her endlessly to tell 
them what went wrong but Ariel would just give them that same soulless 
expression, assuring them that she was okay.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie had 
suspected that it had something to do with Joe and Selina. For the past 
few days, Ariel and Joe hadn't interacted much. For a pair of lovers, 
that was definitely something fishy.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel had been too 
absorbed in her own world these days that she had forgotten to tell 
Rainie and Gillian about her "break-up" with Joe and that she had 
completely lost the bet. She was a bit taken aback when they asked her 
about him because she thought she had told them.</p><p> </p><p>"Ariel, 
tell us! What exactly happened between you two?" Rainie asked, shaking 
her friend. "You guys were good before! Is it because Selina is always 
around Joe?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel looked at her friend, alarmed at the mention of Selina. "Selina? Joe likes Selina..." she said monotonously.</p><p> </p><p>"What?
 That's impossible!" Rainie screeched. "Sure they may chat with each 
other merrily, but didn't that girl say they were friends from long ago?
 Come on, that day when he saved you on the rooftop, didn't that say 
anything?"</p><p> </p><p>"Rainie, calm down," Gillian stroke Rainie's shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>"Gillian, how can I calm down? Look at her, just look at her!" Rainie cried. "She is like a zombie! It's just not like her!"</p><p> </p><p>Gillian
 had to agree. Ariel, no matter what the situation was, never lost her 
fervor and enthusiasm. How could the girl change so much? Even the 
genuis Gillian couldn't comprehend. "Ariel, you have to tell us what 
happened. Why are you like this?"</p><p> </p><p>"Rainie, Gillian... do 
think you think it was stupid of me to fall in love with Joe?" Ariel 
suddenly asked, a genuine desire to know sparking in her eyes. Still, 
she embodied the image of a lifeless doll.</p><p> </p><p>Gillian and Rainie exchanged glances, uncertain of how to answer. They didn't understand why Ariel would ask such a question.</p><p> </p><p>"Of course not! How could it be stupid?" Rainie asked. "It's not a sin to fall in love. Besides, Joe likes you, doesn't he?"</p><p> </p><p>"He does?" Ariel asked, blinking furiously, confused for a second. "No... you're wrong... He likes Selina..."</p><p> </p><p>"Arg!" Rainie blew up, pulling her hair. "Gillian! What is wrong with her?!"</p><p> </p><p>Gillian
 bit her lips. "I think Joe really does like Selina. Ariel wouldn't turn
 out this way if he didn't. Although she may seem like a tough person, 
but she's a very fragile girl. She must have been hurt by that. I 
remember she reacted the same way when her dad died years ago."</p><p> </p><p>"Why
 that bastard!" There was a sudden thirst to kill in Rainie. "I can't 
believe it! I thought they were just friends?! Why, that evil Selina 
must have seduced Joe. Where is she? I need to give her a good lashing!"</p><p> </p><p>"Rainie,
 don't be rash!" Gillian hissed, pulling her friend back from bursting 
into a run. "You don't know the situation yet. Being impulsive will only
 make matters worse!"</p><p> </p><p>"Arg! Then what am I supposed to 
do?" Rainie pulled her hair as she stomped on the grass with rising 
frustration. "It's all my stupid fault for daring her to pursue Joe! If 
it weren't for me, she wouldn't turn out this way!"</p><p> </p><p>"Don't blame yourself. Nobody knew it was going to turn out like this."</p><p> </p><p>"No!
 I have to do something!" Rainie smashed a fist into her palm. "I'm 
going to find Selina." Before Gillian could stop her, Rainie broke into a
 sprint towards the entrance to the school, determined to fish out 
Selina from whatever class she was having.</p><p> </p><p>"Rainie!" 
Gillian hollered, panic breaking out of her forehead. She wanted to 
chase after the girl, but looking at the sad Ariel, she couldn't bear to
 leave her alone.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie was running down the hallways 
with fiery spirits. She heard that Selina took piano class so she 
hurriedly dashed towards that place.</p><p> </p><p>"Selina Ren!" Rainie 
yelled once she arrived at the doorway. Everyones' eyes snapped on her 
but she didn't give a damn. Selina was just playing the piano and was 
completely surprised. "Selina Ren! You come out here, NOW!"</p><p> </p><p>Selina
 looked at her, curious as to what was going on. Rainie's threatening 
eyes demanded that she come right at this instant, but it wasn't because
 of such that made Selina abide. She had a feeling it had something to 
do with Ariel.</p><p> </p><p>When the girls were outside in the empty 
hallway, Rainie immediately cut straight to the point. "You! I demand 
you leave this school NOW!"</p><p> </p><p>"Why?" Selina asked, baffled at the girl's harshness towards her.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, don't pretend to be all innocent, Miss I-think-I'm-so-pure. I know what you did to Joe."</p><p> </p><p>"What are you talking about?" Selina asked, a bit worried. "Something happened to Joe?"</p><p> </p><p>The
 girl's concern and eagerness sickened Rainie all the more. She couldn't
 believe the extent of hypocrisy and lies of Selina's tone. "You think 
you're so smart? Hah! Guess you're not! I can see through you like 
glass! I know you totally seduced Joe into your charm--"</p><p> </p><p>"What? Seduce Joe?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yes! I can't believe you'd do such a thing! Joe and Ariel were fine before you came in between them!"</p><p> </p><p>"What?" Alarm suddenly filled Selina's eyes. "What did you just say? Joe and Ariel was an item?"</p><p> </p><p>"Don't
 try to act like you don't know anything! Yes! They were the perfect 
pair! Let me tell you, skank, what you and Joe had was a thing of the 
past. I don't care what relationship you had had with him, or if he's 
smitten by your seductive claws, but I'm telling you! Joe and Ariel is a
 match made in heaven! So give it up, bitch, and go back to where you 
came from!"</p><p> </p><p>Rainie was breathing hard, her chest heaving up and down continuously as she spat her words with aversion.</p><p> </p><p>"Why does everyone keep saying he likes me?"</p><p> </p><p>Rainie's
 eyes widened even more. "What are you trying to imply? You think you're
 so great? So what if he likes you? It's probably because you used dirty
 tricks--"</p><p> </p><p>"Have you said enough?" Suddenly, Joe's voice 
bounced off the empty space. Rainie and Selina both tore their gaze away
 from each other and focused on Joe, who seemed rather bothered and 
frustrated.</p><p> </p><p>"You!" Rainie stomped towards him. "I need to 
give you a good scolding too. How dare you, how dare you!" With violence
 and fury, she poked at his chest at every single sentence. "I entrusted
 my friend to you and you broke her heart! How dare you!"</p><p> </p><p>Joe grabbed her hand and stopped her. "Mind you, my chest is not a pillow," he spat coldly.</p><p> </p><p>Selina sauntered towards them. "Joe, is it true? You and Ariel were an item?"</p><p> </p><p>Rainie
 glared at Selina. Oh so that two-faced was going to feign innocence to 
her dear Joe! She suddenly felt the urge to choke her.</p><p> </p><p>Joe's eyes remained unflinching. "That was only for a bet."</p><p> </p><p>"A bet?" Selina was staggered.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie
 unhesitatingly jumped in, disinclined to let Selina have a single 
satisfaction that she suspected was rising. "Mind you, it was a bet that
 bred LOVE! Sure it was only because of a challenge that Ariel chased 
after him, but I could tell--"</p><p> </p><p>"Stop talking rubbish," Joe interrupted her with a sneer of irritation. "It was merely a bet and nothing else."</p><p> </p><p>"You're lying. If you didn't have any feelings for her, you wouldn't have cared so much for her that day on the rooftop--"</p><p> </p><p>"Joe,
 do you really like me?" Selina put a halt to Rainie's sentence as she 
fixed her gaze on him, shooting him a cornered question. Her directness 
threw both Joe and Rainie off their tracks.</p><p> </p><p>"Look, skank, don't you think you can--"</p><p> </p><p>"Joe,
 do you?" Selina approached him with a strong determination to pry an 
answer from him. She was so rigid that he had to stumble a few steps 
back. "I'm asking you, Joe. Do you like me?"</p><p> </p><p>Joe could not
 fathom what was lying in her eyes, but she seemed so fierce; it was a 
side of her he had never seen before. Did she really want to know? Joe 
realized that this moment was what he had been longing for in those 
years when she was absent from his life. But...</p><p> </p><p>"Tell me! Do you?!"</p><p> </p><p>Rainie decided to speak up for him. "Obviously, he doesn't even--"</p><p> </p><p>"Yes."</p><p> </p><p>Rainie's eyes inflated as disbelief crept up to her face. "You're clearly lying--"</p><p> </p><p>"I like you, Selina," Joe said.</p><p> </p><p>Selina stepped closer to him. "Kiss me."</p><p> </p><p>"You skank!" Rainie cursed madly. “I knew you were pretending to be innocent all along!”</p><p> </p><p>"Joe,
 you said you like me. Well then, prove it and kiss me!" Selina 
demanded, pushing him towards a wall. Joe was shocked at her fierceness.
 The innocence that had always surrounded her all seemed to have 
disappeared into thin air.</p><p> </p><p>"I'll tell you. I like you too.
 Hell, I even love you. I’ve wanted to tell you for a long time already 
but I was never really sure if you felt the same." She watched him, 
absorbing every single detail. "What are you waiting for, Joe? You 
already got my answer. What have you got to lose? Kiss me."</p><p> </p><p>Everything
 felt so wrong. The way she was so close to him, the way her eyes stared
 deep into him, and the way she was expecting it from him. Even the way 
he was standing just did not feel right. God, what was happening?</p><p> </p><p>PA!</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 stood from a distance, hands clasping her mouth. Her bag had dropped to
 the floor. Gillian was standing behind her, and they were both equally 
shocked at the scene.</p><p> </p><p>Selina glanced towards Ariel, 
bearing her a cynical smile before she turned back to face Joe. "Joe, 
I'm waiting. Didn't you say you like me? Show it to me. Kiss me."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel's
 eyes watered as she watched the two. Joe was staring deep into Selina's
 eyes and from where she stood she saw the closeness between them that 
sent pain searing through every part of her body. The sight before her 
just confirmed about every single idea in her head. Joe likes Selina. 
Selina likes Joe. They were the perfect match.</p><p> </p><p>Selina tiptoed, ready to close the gap between them. Everyone watched with tension and surprise.</p><p> </p><p>But
 Ariel turned away. She could not bear standing there to see it happen. 
Like a mouse running from danger, she sped down the hallway with tears 
gushing out of her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 sat in the auditorium, curled up in a fetal position. The tears kept 
coming as the scene from before ran across her mind. She had long known 
Joe liked Selina and had accepted it and given up, but just seeing them 
together in reality was just too much for her to stomach.</p><p> </p><p>She
 gazed at the piano standing gloriously on the stage, suddenly 
remembering the first time she met Joe face to face. That time, he was 
playing a beautiful melody, one that she could never forget in her 
lifetime. She remembered how mesmerized she was and how touched she 
felt.</p><p> </p><p>And then it all dawned upon her.</p><p> </p><p>Selina could play the piano perfectly as well.</p><p> </p><p>It
 was silly to put them together, because there were plenty who had the 
same musical talent. But Selina and Joe had known each other from the 
past. Didn't Joe once tell her about a girl who befriended him in the 
past while the world ignored him?  What if... Who knows, maybe Selina 
was the one who taught Joe how to play piano. Ariel knew she was going 
crazy, but everything just seemed to fall into place.</p><p> </p><p>"If it isn't the girl whom I hate most..."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 noticed someone standing before her, and she gazed up, meeting Jolin's 
face, the person she least wanted to see, especially in this condition. 
"Go away. I don't want to argue with you," Ariel looked away.</p><p> </p><p>Jolin
 rolled her eyes as she bent down to her level. "Please, does it look 
like I want to be here and watch you cry pathetically?"</p><p> </p><p>"What?
 Haven't you always wanted to see me end up like this? That Joe will 
leave me one day? Well, surprise! He finally left me! Are you happy?" 
Ariel spat bitterly.</p><p> </p><p>"I told you," Jolin said smugly. "Joe
 never takes girls seriously. He just doesn't give a damn about them. 
Getting involved with him is committing suicide. Didn't I tell you to 
back off in the first place?"</p><p> </p><p>Jolin's harsh words dampened
 Ariel's wounds. She didn't need anyone to make matters worse for her. 
"Please, Jolin, I beg you. Just leave me alone."</p><p> </p><p>"Why are 
you so weak?" Jolin asked belittlingly. "I thought you were stronger 
than me. Sure, I cried tons when he rejected me, but I've always thought
 you were stronger."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel did not comprehend what Jolin 
was trying to say. Here was a girl who detested her with every piece of 
her fiber, who once sent her to the hospital bed, trying to console her 
cracked emotions?</p><p> </p><p>Jolin sighed. "Let me tell you. I'm very
 glad that you didn't back off. Even though, your whole purpose was to 
satisfy a stupid bet, I'm still glad that you never gave up on him.” The
 sincerity in Jolin's tone shocked Ariel far more than anything else. 
"Look, I can tell that Joe likes you. He may not realize it, but he 
does. I've been with him for a year so I have some idea. He always 
treats girls carelessly, like I said. But with you, he's different."</p><p> </p><p>"What
 are you talking about?" Ariel asked, sniffing, not at all convinced. 
"He treats me the same as every other girl. He insults me. He makes fun 
of me. If he likes me, he wouldn't do that to me."</p><p> </p><p>"Come 
on, don't tell me you're that stupid?" Jolin rolled her eyes at the 
girl’s ignorance that ran too deep for her tolerance to bear. “He may 
act that way, but inside, a totally different story is brewing. Didn't 
he show how much he cared for you? Or do you need me to remind you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Care?” Ariel asked.</p><p> </p><p>“That
 day when I beat you up. Have you no idea how worried he was? And then 
that day at the rooftop. The way he looked at Mike. I had never seen him
 that way before. If you don’t call that care, then I don’t know what 
you call it.”</p><p> </p><p>Ariel let Jolin's words sink in her brain. 
She was right. Joe had been very caring towards her. Wasn't that why she
 fell so deeply in love with him? Every time she thought he hated her, 
he turned things around with considerate actions.</p><p> </p><p>But then, so what? So what if he cared for her? The person who he really loved wasn't her.</p><p> </p><p>"He
 likes Selina. He even admits it," Ariel said, remembering that night 
with uneasiness and hurt. "I can see it from his eyes. He really meant 
it. Compared to the time when we kissed, he clearly had no feelings for 
me!"</p><p> </p><p>"What?" Jolin asked, big-eyed.</p><p> </p><p>"I said he likes Selina. He said so himself!"</p><p> </p><p>"No, what you said after that."</p><p> </p><p>"I can see it in his eyes! His love for Selina! While for me, I saw nothing when I withdrew from his kiss!" Ariel yelled.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh my god, you idiot," Jolin spat condescendingly. "Why didn't you say so before?"</p><p> </p><p>"What does it matter? The person he likes is Selina!" Even the words hurt when she said it.</p><p> </p><p>"Please.
 You are indeed very stupid," Jolin rolled his eyes as Ariel shot her 
glares. "Don't tell me you didn't get it? Come on, I mean, he kissed 
you! Could there be any clearer proof? When someone kissed you that 
means he likes you!"</p><p> </p><p>"No!" Ariel shot back. "You're wrong!
 He hates me! He only kissed me because I asked him to! And the other 
time, it was only because--"</p><p> </p><p>"It was more than once?!" Jolin asked, bewildered.</p><p> </p><p>"--of the stupid contract!"</p><p> </p><p>Jolin
 stood up, crossing her arms with full discontent. "I don't even know 
why I bothered talking to a thickhead like you. I don't care if he 
kissed you because you asked him to or for a stupid contract, whatever 
that is about I don't even give a damn, but all I know is when a person 
is willing to kiss you, it means that he likes you. I mean, hello!!! A 
kiss is a kiss! Would you kiss someone you hate?!"</p><p> </p><p>Jolin's
 words bombarded Ariel's ears but they all successfully sunk into her 
brain. Ariel immediately looked up and blinked at Jolin. "But then why 
would he say--"</p><p> </p><p>"GO FIGURE YOU STUPID DWIT!" Jolin 
shouted, losing her patience. "God, speaking to you pisses me off. 
Whatever, I don't care anymore. You know the answer within yourself. I'm
 leaving."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel watched Jolin leave, speechless. That 
girl was fierce, but that was how her words held so much impact. If 
Jolin's words were true, Joe must love Selina then.</p><p> </p><p>Because willingly, he had kissed her.<br>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>There
