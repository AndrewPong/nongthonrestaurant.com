</p><p class="tocn"></p><h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="tocn"></p><h4><!--Subtitle begin-->Rejection? Not Yet, Boy.<!--Subtitle end--></h4>
<!--Chapter begin-->
Ariel banged her head against the desk. Old Mr. Wang's monotonous voice 
did nothing but worsen her state. She recalled all of the things 
happened in the past two days with remorse and humiliation. First of 
all, running into Mike was a bad blow to her opened wounds. Secondly, 
that stupid challenge would not leave the premises of her bothered mind.
 Lastly and most mortifying of all, that Joe Cheng rejected her not 
once, but *two* times.<p>Ariel remembered that day clearly when he left her home.</p><p>"I'm not going on that trip to the temple, just so you know."</p><p>God
 damn it. God should forbid anyone to speak in such a condescending and 
arrogant tone! What clearly made it worse was the fact he announced it 
to her grandpa and his mother as if she was some sort of unwanted, 
contagious object.</p><p>Ariel had enough.</p><p>She knew that it was 
impossible to back out of the challenge. She would prove to her friends 
and Mike that she was moving on. And so, despite her pride, Ariel would 
continue to march on this road. Date him then dump him.</p><p>Of course 
she wasn't going to speed onto it without a proper map. Ariel had some 
hidden plans to ease the hardship the road will offer.</p><p>But first of all, somehow, some way, she just had to get him to go on a date with her.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>It
 was lunch time. When the bell rang, Ariel immediately sped out of class
 on the quest to search for Joe. Rainie and Gillian were both alarmed 
that she was not going to eat lunch with them, but Ariel had no choice. 
When it came to Joe Cheng, even three months wouldn’t be enough to do 
anything. Time was a bomb and she had to make every second useful.</p><p>Ariel
 didn't know where Joe would be at this time. Where would someone who 
hated accompany eat? Hell, did he even eat lunch at all? He was always 
nonexistent when it came to hanging out time. Ariel won't be surprised 
if he's hiding in a closet right now.</p><p>It took her approximately ten minutes running from one end to another to find Joe in the school library, reading books.</p><p>Talk about a big nerd! Ariel giggled mentally as she approached him.</p><p>"Hey," she said, slipping into the seat next to him.</p><p>Joe
 was initially alarmed, but when he saw it was Ariel, an annoyed 
expression scattered on his face as he turned away, pretending not to 
see her.</p><p>Ariel frowned, not liking his reaction. But she tamed her
 anger down. She shouldn't be too harsh--that might backfire her plans. 
"So... What are you reading?"</p><p>Of course, as she expected, he ignored her again.</p><p>Ariel
 took a peek at the book's title. "Japan and War?" She asked, slightly 
amused. "So, you like history? You defnitely look like someone who 
appreciate those stuff."</p><p>She thought she saw a smirk. "Yeah, unlike some bonehead."</p><p>Ariel
 flinched. He was not hesitant to insult her at any given situation, 
even when she was actually complimenting him. Usually, Ariel would blow 
up and give him a piece of her mind, but for her own sake, she will 
restrain herself. She mustn't be too aggressive! "Well, what good does 
reading do you when you don't even know what's filial piety is," she 
commented coolly with pounds of underlying meanings. "Ahh~You're so 
handsome, so tall, and so smart. Such a pity that you're cold-blooded 
and bad."</p><p>Ariel watched him. She saw the way his eyes flinched 
with irritation and smiled, knowing that she must have stricken a chord 
of some sort. As she expected and hoped for, he turned around and gave 
her a cold glare. One that could make one's hair all stand up.</p><p>"Just stay what you want to say. Stop beating around the bush," he spat.</p><p>With
 a smile of gayety, she scurried to his other side such that her face 
was nearer towards his. "Go on that temple date with me, please?"</p><p>Almost instantly, he uttered, "No."</p><p>Ariel plastered on a puppy look, eyes begging. "Please?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Come on. Just a date. Please?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"It's
 not like it's going to be only us two. There's my grandpa, and there's 
your mom. You should accompany her, no? Come on, please?" She nudged 
him.</p><p>"I said, no!" Joe hissed, goaded at last. His dynamic tone 
caught several people's attentions and he turned away, slightly 
embarrassed.</p><p>"Why?!" Ariel asked, infuriation simmering inside her
 blood. His stubbornness was something that she could not understand. It
 was just a tiny date; it wasn't as if she was asking him to commit 
murder, so why was he so insistent on rejecting her?</p><p>"Because I said so."</p><p>Joe
 began packing his books, declaring his nil tolerance to further the 
conversation with her. Ariel saw his haste as a contribution to her 
growing desperation and grabbed his backpack so he couldn't go. "If 
you're not telling me the real reason why, I'm not going to let go!"</p><p>"What do you get out of this?" Joe asked vexingly.</p><p>"Not going to tell you unless you tell me your reason."</p><p>"Has anyone ever told you you're a pest?"</p><p>Ariel stared at him, slightly offended. "Well, has anyone ever told you you're pretty ugly when you're stubborn?"</p><p>"Bullshit," he coldly spat, not at all affronted. "Are you going to let go or not?"</p><p>"No!" Ariel shook her head.</p><p>The annoyance on his face grew more visible by the second. "There's a cockroach by your arm."</p><p>"What!"
 Ariel's eyes widened as she jumped frightfully, the mere word 
'cockroach' making her heart thrash a thousand times harder.</p><p>Joe 
immediately took the chance to snatch his backpack from her. With a 
smirk, he threw it upon his shoulder and gave her a derogatory look, not
 minding the extra attention he was getting from nearby readers. "You're
 so scared of something so little when you're that big?" he asked with 
mock dripping his words. "Stupid baby."</p><p>And he walked away, just like that, leaving Ariel widened-eyed and sputtering with disbelief.</p><p>Strike three!</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Two more days.</p><p>Her
 dateline was just two more days. Ariel's mind was exploding with 
thoughts of how to force Joe to comply to her date. He had a polished 
reputation of not wavering his decisions once he made his mind, but the 
determined Ariel knew that no matter how confident a person was, he must
 have a weakness. She was planning to channel on that weakness--whatever
 it was--and make him agree to their date!</p><p>Ariel flinched. She had
 been so crazy with the bet these days she wasn't sure if she was 
herself anymore. However, the image of Mike fondling with his girlfriend
 would constantly haunt and taunt her mind, successfully igniting her 
will to harden her urge for revenge. She just couldn't take how he was 
laughing at her behind her back. She must counterattack; there was no 
other choice.</p><p>"Exams are just around the corner," Mr. Wang 
announced to the disinterested class, shuffling a stack of papers in his
 grip. "I expect that everyone study hard and thrive for a good score." 
Here, he specifically aimed a glance at Ariel, who only shrugged off 
slightly and returned to her train of thoughts.</p><p>"However, I am 
aware that many of my students are lazy when it comes to studying," the 
old man drone on monotonously. "Therefore I've constucted a plan to pair
 you up with a study buddy. You must aid each other on the preparation 
worksheets. I expect effort and good results. Understand?"</p><p>There 
was an occasional groan here and there but it seemed like everybody was 
fine with Mr. Wang's wacky antics. Silence enveloped the room as the old
 man began to recite names.</p><p>"...Joe and Ariel."</p><p>Shooting her
 head up, Ariel turned to glance furtively at Joe, who remained 
indifferent to whatever that was surrounding him. Normally, Ariel would 
never turn her eyesight back there, for nothing held her interest. 
However, ever since the deal to pursue Joe, Ariel found herself stealing
 glances at his direction and paying more attention to him than she had 
ever done before.</p><p>Initially, Ariel didn't like the idea of working
 with a high-class arrogant jerk, but the second she realized it was a 
golden opportunity, Ariel swapped on a pleased smile. She didn't care 
what he was thinking at the moment about their partnership, but she was 
sure as hell elated that she was given this rare chance to get close to 
him. God was helping her. She definitely can make him comply to their 
date two days later...</p><p>"Any questions? If not, then you are dismissed."</p><p>The bell rang right after Mr. Wang finished his sentence. Mobs of bodies began swarming out of the door.</p><p>Ariel quickly caught up to Joe, smiling in mischief. "Hey, *partner*!"</p><p>She
 saw the way his eyes cast down at her in a degrading manner, but tried 
her best to suppress the urge to kick him. "What?" he said.</p><p>"Didn't you listen? We're study buddies! Say, why don't we start today?"</p><p>He rolled his eyes. "I have something important to do."</p><p>"Come on"! Ariel insisted, grabbing onto his arm in a friendly manner. "What can be more important than studying for exams?"</p><p>He
 stopped in his tracks, studying her suspiciously. "Surprise, surprise. 
The incompetent student wants to study. What else do you have up in your
 sleeves?"</p><p>Ariel quickly frowned at his insensitive tone. He never
 ceased to supply her with hurtful adjectives; however, upon remembering
 her mission, Ariel was willing to push aside all grudges and be 
generous for the sake of victory. "Listen, I am hardly ever determined 
to study for exams. You have better not crush my good intention to help 
you!"</p><p>Joe rose an eyebrow, peering down at her further. He made a 
small movement of inching closer to her face. "Help me? It's more like 
the opposite."</p><p>"What does that supposed to mean, you dolt?!" Ariel
 shot fiercely, stepping back to escape the close proximity of his body.
 "I am not as incompetent as you think! Don't you know your..." Ariel 
couldn't find a subject to fill in the blank. She was startled at the 
possibility that he might as well was good in everything damn subject. 
"--your... handwriting needs a lot of work!" she supplied lamely. "The 
examiners probably can't even read your essay! You just remember these 
things when you get back your score! Hmph!"</p><p>Joe rolled his eyes. 
"Bad handwriting doesn't necessarily mean I'll fail the test. As long as
 it's legible, I don't see a problem."</p><p>"Well..." Ariel was racking her mind for something smart to say. "Umm.--"</p><p>"Just admit that you want my help," Joe filled in, smirking.</p><p>"What?"
 Ariel widened her eyes. Pfft! That was far from her intention. She 
never studied in her whole entire life and still managed to pass the 
class with credible marks. She did not need his help!</p><p>Seeing that 
she was stumped, Joe continued, "Look, there's no need for us to 
cooperate. I see no benefit to help you. In fact, you might delay my 
studies even further."</p><p>Ariel couldn't stand the way he spoke of 
contempt and scorn. Just because he was smarter than her didn't mean he 
had the right to speak so highly of himself. She had her own pride and 
dignity, too. "Wei! What's wrong with you? Don't you know that it is 
assigned that we *must* study together? If I go and tell Mr. Wang of 
your non-cooperative attitude, what will he say? I'm not just doing this
 for my sake. It's for your own good too."</p><p>"Are you done?" asked Joe cooly, still disinclined to comply.</p><p>For
 Ariel, this was the last straw. "No!" she yelled, inching closer to 
him. "I can't believe you have all those admirers that you have! You're 
heartless! They can't see it but I do! Have you ever thought that you're
 not the most incredible thing to grace this earth? That there is more 
than just brains and looks?! You might get by for a little while, but 
your cold attitude isn't going to get you very far in the real world, 
*Prince*."</p><p>There was a slight moment of silence as Ariel witnessed the softening of his eyes. Did she touch a soft spot?</p><p>"You're
 just yapping all this bullshit because you want to study right?" He 
asked, without glancing down at her. "Fine. We'll meet in the library 
fifteen minutes from now."</p><p>And with that, he trode away, leaving Ariel completely surprised.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>"Here, you read that, and I'll read this. After we're done, we'll exchange analysis."</p><p>Ariel
 stared down at the book Joe just handed her. It was thick, almost two 
inches. What was he thinking? "Wei, you're not serious, are you? How in 
the world are we going to finish these books?!"</p><p>"Who said we have to finish it?" Joe said in that same dergatory tone. "Don't you know how to skim and pick up the main points?"</p><p>"Hah, you might as well just read the summary!" Ariel snapped.</p><p>Joe rolled his eyes. "Summaries aren't detailed enough. You need to delve in deeper. Minor details can also be important."</p><p>"This is foreign language," Ariel pointed out the obvious. "Not literature class. We just need to get the mechanics right."</p><p>"Is
 that how you view it?" Joe asked incredulously. "Look, you have to 
write an essay in English. You have to analyze things. You're not going 
to pass if you just study the mechanics--something you should have 
already known, anyway."</p><p>Ariel had to try her best to restrain from
 cracking his jaw open. All throughout the session, he continuously 
hinted that she was dumb. He was always the one commanding her to do 
this and that, never once asking her how she thought or felt toward the 
subject. There was some things that she couldn't even understand yet he 
made no effort to clear it for her; instead, he continued on and on, 
expecting that she understand every word.</p><p>"I quit!" She announced heatedly. "Who cares about the essay part? As long as I do good in the other sections, I'll pass!"</p><p>"So, that's it? Your determination is that thin?" Joe asked. "Don't you want to improve your scores?"</p><p>Ariel
 thought for a moment. Not really. The actual reason that she even 
bothered to study with him was because she wanted to get close to him. 
She had not neglected her mission to ask him out on the date. However, 
for the past hour or so, her brain was tortured with so many foreign 
material that it almost lost its normal function. Now that he reminded 
her, Ariel decided to shove aside all grievances and swapped on a smile.
 "Hey, Joe. Have you considered my proposition?"</p><p>He looked rather confused. "What proposition?"</p><p>"I meant the date!" Ariel said with a hopeful face.</p><p>Joe's expression turned grim all of a sudden. "No."</p><p>“You!”</p><p>Ariel
 stopped in puzzlement. She turned around and saw a beautiful girl 
walking towards them with a smug look on her face. Her heels clicked 
against the marble floor, her stride a marveling sophistication only 
found on super models.</p><p>"You're talking to me?" Ariel asked, slightly stunned at the fact someone unfamiliar was talking to her.</p><p>The
 girl flicked her hair. For a moment, Ariel couldn't stop thinking how 
beautiful she looked when she did that. Undoubtedly, she must have a 
line of guys chasing after her. With that kind of beauty, it was hard 
not to have that kind of popularity. "You're Ariel Lin Yi Chen aren't 
you, the girl who got dumped by her boyfriend and goes after boys?." It 
was more of a statement than a friendly question.</p><p>Ariel nodded, 
still baffled as ever. "Do I know you?" 'Wow, I didn't know I was that 
popular and well known!' she thought. But then, the way the girl said it
 sounded malicious, if not acidic.</p><p>Wait a minute, ‘goes after boys?’ Where in the world did that idea come from?</p><p>The
 girl approached closer towards her, her strong fragrance attacking 
Ariel's nose. Only girls like her could pull off that kind of stunt 
without being laughed at. "What does someone like you have to do with 
the cold prince?” she asked in a degrading tone while trying to stay 
sweet and endearing to Joe. “Joe, you shouldn’t degrade yourself by 
sitting with her. Why don’t we go over there?”</p><p>Ariel blinked. "Excuse me?" she asked.</p><p>"Take
 a look at yourself. Fine, I'll be kind today. Take my advice, little 
girl. You're so ugly. You should give up and save yourself from 
embarrassment."</p><p>Exasperation immediately thundered down Ariel's nerves. "Wei, who do you think you are?"</p><p>"Oh,
 you don't know?" The girl asked. "I'm Jolin Tsai. Well, I don't blame 
you. You seem like that type who's too stupid to take notice of these 
things anyway. I don't mind. Just make sure you don't forget my name 
from today onwards, bitch."</p><p>"Watch your words," Ariel grumbled, 
returning an equally fierce glare. "Why would a princess like you be in 
the library anyway? Shouldn't you be at the malls or something?"</p><p>Jolin
 smirked. "Oh, I heard that Joe's here, so I just wanted to pay him a 
visit. I didn't expect that someone like you would be here too..."</p><p>"Oh?
 Do I sense jealously?" Ariel batted her eyelashes. "Ah, sorry that I 
snatched your man. How about next weekend? I'll make sure he's free."</p><p>The
 clenching of Jolin's jaw was audibly obvious, however, she still bore 
the same sweet grin. "Don't get cocky, bitch. You're just lucky you're 
paired up with Joe." Realizing that she was paying more attention to a 
bitch than to her precious crush, Jolin quickly diverted her attention. 
"So Joe, are you busy after this? I was hoping that we can hang out..."</p><p>"I'm busy."</p><p>"But--" Jolin wanted to protest in that sickeningly high voice of hers.</p><p>"Can't you see?" Ariel interrupted, "He's a busy man. Got no time for you."</p><p>"You..."
 Jolin looked like she wanted to pull out Ariel's hair as her nostrils 
flared. However, she ignored the signs Joe was sending her, and plopped 
on the seat next to his, purposely scooting closer to him. The way she 
teased his hair was an inconspicuous method of flirtation that made 
Ariel want to vomit badly. "How about this weekend? My family's holding a
 barbeque. It would be so much fun if we both can hang out together at 
my house..."</p><p>Joe ignored her, his eyes glued to the book.</p><p>Ariel
 snifled a snicker, but Jolin caught it. Embarrassment further 
reinforced her attempt to possess Joe's attention. "Joe! I am more 
interesting than that stupid book!" She yanked his arm in a force that 
sent Joe out of his concentration. "Look at me!"</p><p>Jeez, Ariel thought. Talk about desperate!</p><p>"Listen, Jolin. I'm busy this weekend," Joe repeated agitatedly.</p><p>"With what?" Jolin stubbornly probed.</p><p>"It's none of your business," Joe snapped.</p><p>"I
 must know!" She insisted. Then she turned her attention to Ariel and 
gasped in horror. "What, don't tell me you're spending your weekend with
 her?"</p><p>Ariel was about to rebuke when what Joe did next completely threw her back. "Yes. We have a date."</p><p>"Whs-what?"
 Jolin sputtered, disbelief suffusing her cheeks. "That is impossible! 
She's... she's one ugly bitch! You cannot go out with her!!!"</p><p>That
 brat! Ariel seethed inside mentally, glaring at Jolin with revulsion so
 great it could reach the sky. Ariel began to wonder what sort of 
relationship Jolin had with Joe. Could they be ex-lovers? But then 
again, Ariel had never heard about him going out with anyone, so that 
wasn't possible. The only other answer she could come up with was that 
Jolin was just another secret admirer.</p><p>Ariel could tell from the 
way Joe's flinched that he wanted her claws off of him. Ariel smirked, 
deciding to give him a hand. "Oh, come on, Jolin. How low can you stoop?
 He's already rejected you. Save the last piece of your dignity and take
 the hint to leave."</p><p>Jolin glared at Ariel and then turned back to
 Joe, expecting that he'd speak up in her defense. Much to her chagrin, 
he did none of that. Completely defeated, Jolin stomped off in sass. 
Even the way she swayed her hips looked majestic.</p><p>Ariel wanted to 
burst out laughing when she caught Joe's grim expression. "Hey, good 
one," she complimented. "You are holding true to your words right? You 
admitted that we have a date. You cannot back out because I'm sure Jolin
 will be chasing your heels. Okay, so it's settled?"</p><p>Joe didn't answer. He only gave her an annoyed look.</p><p>Ariel laughed hard inside. Who ever thought that this was so easy?</p><p>			<br>---------------------------------------</p><p>I hope that wasn't such a long boring chapter ya... You guys' comments really make us want to update!</p><p>Considering
 Joe's icy personality, he wouldn't agree unless something forces him 
to, so there you go. Oh yeah, we have nothing against Jolin, but just 
thought it'd be interesting to cast her in the role. It's just a short 
introduction to her chracter.</p><p>Anyway, do look forward to the date 
as Bunny Ears mui mui and I have already planned things out *hehe* More 
ArJoe chapters, definitely</p><p>Comment pretty please? *puppy eyes*</p><p>THANK YOU!!! Love you all!</p><p>&lt;3 Nhu
