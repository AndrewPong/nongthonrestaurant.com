<p class="tocn"></p><h4><!--Subtitle begin-->The Frost Eating the Flames<!--Subtitle end--></h4>
<!--Chapter begin-->
Ariel was standing in the hallways by the library, impatiently waiting 
for Joe so that they could proceed their study session. He had announced
 after class that he needed fifteen minutes before he could come down 
with her to the library. The curious Ariel couldn't help but wonder what
 he could be doing because as she distinctly recalled, he asked the same
 thing last time.<p> </p><p>Shrugging, Ariel decided to brush it off, 
knowing her place. She had no right to butt into his business. It wasn't
 like she was all that interested either. The only reason she was 
adamant about attending the study session was because she believed more 
time spending together with him would eventually lure him to an 
agreement of a relationship. A fake one, of course.</p><p> </p><p>Chances
 might be slim, considering Joe's tough and icy exterior that seemed to 
isolate him off of all ties of connection. But when Ariel recalled the 
way he'd shared his feelings with her that morning in the woods, she 
knew that it couldn't be all that difficult to penetrate into his mind.</p><p> </p><p>Speaking
 of their date, Ariel remembered Joe's taunting eyes as he warned her to
 seal her mouth shut. Although she hated the way he thought he could use
 that dominance on her, Ariel was not a person to go back on her words.</p><p> </p><p>So
 far, Ariel was successful in her attempt at avoidance. No one was 
casting her a suspicious stare or anything of that sort, which was a 
relief on her part. She knew she was being too alert, but she couldn't 
help the anxiety of being caught and then intently interrogated about 
her weekend with the school's most sought-after cold prince.</p><p> </p><p>
 Especially her friends. God, Rainie and Gillian were probably turning 
the school upside down just looking for her. She knew they'd fire 
questions about her progress with the deal. Right now, she didn't want 
to answer any of their concerns, lest carelessness would cost her to 
spill details about her weekend with Joe.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel had 
promised him that she'd keep her mouth shut. Knowing her clumsiness, 
she'd figured she should avoid any risky circumstance for now.</p><p> </p><p>However,
 fate was against her because just as soon as Ariel thought about Rainie
 and Gillian, they simultaneously appeared out of nowhere, approaching 
her.</p><p> </p><p>"So there you are!" Rainie's sharp voice sauntered to her ears.</p><p> </p><p>"What
 are you two doing here?" Ariel asked. "School's out. Knowing you, you'd
 either be at a game, or somewhere in the malls. And Gillian, at home or
 something."</p><p> </p><p>Gillian tilted her glasses. "I will be 
leaving in a moment. We were just passing by when we saw you standing in
 front of the library like a statue. Where were you at lunch, anyway?"</p><p> </p><p>"If I didn't know better, I'd think that you're evading us!" Rainie said.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 scowled at Rainie's words. It seemed like her friends were quick to 
catch the suspicious vibes. "Oh, uh... I had to stay after class to 
finish work."</p><p> </p><p>"Wah... Seriously?!!?" Rainie could hardly 
contain her shock as she clutched tightly onto Ariel. "Why in the world 
would you, of all people, comply with your teacher's demand?"</p><p> </p><p>"Well, he made me!" Ariel quickly lied.</p><p> </p><p>"Knowing
 you, though, I would never expect that you'd comply to a teacher's 
request so easily." The wise Gillian was quick to catch the oddity of 
the situation, for nothing could escape her sharp observational skills. 
"Something sounds fishy."</p><p> </p><p>"Right. So spill now!" Rainie demanded.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel rolled her eyes, crossing her arms in a stubborn display of defiance. "No. There is nothing to say, anyway."</p><p> </p><p>"Liar!"
 Rainie shot, two fierce eyes staring hard. "Remind me again why we're 
best friends. By now, I've picked up a couple of signs. So tell us, what
 have you been up to?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel bit back her lips. This was 
what she dreaded right from the beginning. Who'd know that fate was so 
cruel to have led her friends to sniff her out? If she were to spill out
 the details pertaining to the date with Joe, she would have to prepare 
to receive his merciless execution--whatever it might be.</p><p> </p><p>But
 then she smiled. While Joe did warn her about keeping their date a 
secret, he said nothing about their partnership for the exams study 
session.  "Oh, I'm meeting Joe right now. He agreed to help me study out
 of his own willingness." Ariel grinned.</p><p> </p><p>"WHAT?!" Rainie screamed while Gillian's eyes bulged out in incredulity.</p><p> </p><p>"This
 can't be," Rainie's eyes were round with outrage at the shocking 
revelation. "That was SO quick. How could you guys hook up together so 
fast?"</p><p> </p><p>"Honestly, we aren't officially dating. But we 
might as well be," Ariel winked. "Prepare to sing in front of the school
 any day now, Rainie."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel stifled a giggle. What her 
friends didn't know was Joe was associating with her only because Mr. 
Wang had paired them up. However, Ariel decided to keep quiet about 
that, and let Rainie squirm in anxiety at her potential loss for the 
bet. Victory was almost hers, anyway. Telling Rainie now could only 
serve as mere warnings of her impending lose. The girl was going to have
 to prepare for a big blow.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You..." Rainie almost
 choked in disbelief. "Gillian! You're a smart one. Enlighten me with 
your interpretations! She's lying, isn't she? Joe cannot be possibly 
interested in her!"</p><p> </p><p>"Taking the cold prince's reputation 
into account, he can't possibly agree to hang out with Ariel if there 
aren't feelings involved..." Gillian tilted her glasses as she plunged 
in speculation. "It seems as though Ariel has him trapped in the palm of
 her hand."</p><p> </p><p>Horror swept across Rainie's features. "Impossible!"</p><p> </p><p>"Oh give it up. It's a definite win for me," Ariel winked.</p><p> </p><p>"Not so fast though..." Rainie spoke up, her eyes sparkling with a sinister gleam. "I guess it's time for me to interfere."</p><p> </p><p>"I see the gears in your head are working over-time," Gillian observed, concerned about the risk of Rainie's new idea.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie rolled her eyes. "Please. This is MY bet and I have the right to do whatever means to win it!"</p><p> </p><p>"That's not fair. You cannot just decide to do that when I'm at the most critical stage!" Ariel strongly protested.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie
 smirked sinisterly. "Hey. We have never stated that tricks are not 
allowed, have we? You are putting in a tremendous amount of effort to 
win this bet. Why can't I do the same, huh?"</p><p> </p><p>"You, loser!" Ariel shot exasperatedly.</p><p> </p><p>"SKANK!" Rainie stuck her tongue out.</p><p> </p><p>"I
 don't know if you're even my friend! If you're helping me to get over 
Mike, why make this so difficult?!" Ariel wanted to scream.</p><p> </p><p>Rainie
 rolled her eyes. "It's more fun this way, don't you think? Besides, the
 harder it is for you to win, the better it feels when you reap the 
rewards. Don't you agree, Gillian?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yes."</p><p> </p><p>A
 victorious grin contorted Rainie's lips as she tugged Gillian along. 
"Okay, then Ariel. We'll see who'll be singing in front of the 
school..." With a mischievous wink, they disappeared down the hallways.</p><p> </p><p>Urg!
 Stupid Rainie. Ariel wanted to curse at her friend so badly. How could 
she do this? How? Disgruntled, Ariel whirled on her heels, suddenly 
remembering that she was supposed to meet Joe now. What was taking that 
jerk so long?</p><p> </p><p>"You are aware that you're standing there like an idiot." Joe's voice nearly put a stop to her beating heart.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 whipped on her heels and saw the usual indifference on his face. "Whoa.
 What are you doing there behind me? You know antics like those can give
 people a heart attack?"</p><p> </p><p>"Only those who have a guilty conscience would feel that way."</p><p> </p><p>"Exactly what are you trying to imply?" Ariel asked irritatingly.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 peered at those chilling amber eyes that daunted so many and gasped 
audibly. Anxiety made her fingers curl. Could he have heard their 
conversation?</p><p> </p><p>"Ummm..." Ariel was at the loss for words.</p><p> </p><p>"Come. Let's go," Joe said simply, heading toward the front door.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel gazed at him quizzically. "The library's here."</p><p> </p><p>"Are you such an idiot that you can't even see it's closed?" Joe asked.</p><p> </p><p>Embarrassment
 suffused Ariel's cheeks when she glanced back and realized he was 
right. She probably was too caught up in her moment to see the sign. 
"Oh... Where are we going to study then?" When she asked that question, 
she certainly wasn't expecting a surprise.</p><p> </p><p>"My house."</p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 hadn't recovered from the surprise when Joe announced they were going 
to study at his house. It was hard to believe that such a cold prince 
like him was willing to take it that far. Just what exactly was his 
motive?</p><p> </p><p>Her cynical brain wouldn't let go of all those 
speculations she came up with. Perhaps, he wanted to bring her to his 
house to rape her?! Such idea was always popular in movies and such...</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 smacked herself for her momentary stupid thinking. She was definitely 
putting her head in the gutter. Why would she want to do that?!</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 must have noticed her absent-minded look because he began to talk. 
"We're neighbors, so I guess this isn't such a big deal as it sounds. By
 the way, I dislike the idea of coming to your room again. I feel more 
comfortable at my place."</p><p> </p><p>Yeah, he just had to explain it 
so thoroughly, didn't he? Not to mention, he loved to seize any 
opportunity to throw her an insulting remark. Sure, she remembered the 
day when he came over to her house and intrusively entered her room, 
commenting about her lack of organization and cleanliness while he was 
at it. Stupid jerk.</p><p> </p><p>"That's good because I don't want you in my room either," Ariel rebutted defensively, rolling her eyes at him.</p><p> </p><p>Shortly,
 the door to Joe's house flew open, revealing a cheerful face of a 
middle-aged woman. Her eyes sparked pleasantly at the sight of Ariel. 
"Oh my! Ariel, you’re too kind to pay us a visit!"</p><p> </p><p>"Pleased to see you again, Mrs. Cheng," Ariel smiled politely.</p><p> </p><p>"Mrs. Cheng sounds too awkward and old!" Joe's mother said, beaming with cheekiness. "You can just call me Auntie."</p><p> </p><p>Joe butted in. "Ma... That's too intimate, don't you think?"</p><p> </p><p>"Nonsense!" Joe's mother snapped. "We're neighbors, anyway. It's all right to be intimate with each other. Right, Ariel?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel nodded hesitantly. "Yes... Auntie."</p><p> </p><p>"Come
 in, come in!" The older woman enthusiastically ushered them inside. She
 shut the door and turned to face them, clasping her hands together. It 
was obvious she was delighted to have a guest over. "So, what are you 
guys doing?"</p><p> </p><p>"We're going to study," Joe honestly replied. "So it'll be convenient if you don't interrupt us."</p><p> </p><p>"Of
 course not!" Mrs. Cheng giggled to herself, causing confusion to usurp 
both Ariel and Joe's expressions. "I know better than that..."</p><p> </p><p>Even
 though Mrs. Cheng's assumption was obviously untrue, Ariel couldn't 
help the blush that suffused her cheeks at the implication. There was an
 urge to clarify but then that would only worsen the situation, 
considering how much it'd show that she was thinking inappropriately.</p><p> </p><p>"What are you standing there for? Come up!" Joe berated from upstairs.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel followed, grumbling inside.</p><p> </p><p>His
 room was decorated simply with plain, dark posters pasted against blank
 walls. Its large interiority guaranteed plenty of empty space. There 
was only a bed, a set of drawers, and a desk. It also amazed Ariel how 
neatly and organized he was. There was not even a scratch of paper on 
the floor. The wooden surface was wiped clean without a stain of dusk. 
Was it her imagination, or did Ariel really see a shimmering spark 
somewhere?</p><p> </p><p>"Where should we start?" Ariel asked, digging through her bag for her English binder.</p><p> </p><p>"Continue from where we left off," Joe replied as he took a seat at the desk.</p><p> </p><p>"Wei..."
 Ariel suddenly realized she was still standing. "Where am I supposed to
 sit? There's only one desk... and no extra chair."</p><p> </p><p>"Try the bed," Joe said.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel gulped. "Bed?"</p><p> </p><p>He probably sensed her concern. "Why? Are you afraid you might be enticed by the smell of my sheets?"</p><p> </p><p>"No!"
 Ariel quickly snapped crossly, not believing he was in such a mood to 
say something so dirty. "Not everyone thinks you're the perfect guy, you
 know."</p><p> </p><p>"Whatever. If you don't want to, then try the floor."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 gritted her teeth. Couldn't he accommodate her for once? Couldn't he 
act nice? Even though he had a reputation as a cold prince, it did not 
give him a reason to neglect his female guest and let her sit on the 
floor!</p><p> </p><p>"Wei!! Why can't you sit on the bed and leave the desk to me?" Ariel complained.</p><p> </p><p>"This is my house, and I'll do as I wish."</p><p> </p><p>"I am your guest!"</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 must have known that Ariel was stubborn because he suddenly stormed out
 of the room and returned moments later with a chair. He slammed it down
 next to his. "There, we'll study side by side then."</p><p> </p><p>"I didn't ask for that--"</p><p> </p><p>"Are you sitting or not?" He snapped.</p><p> </p><p>"Fine."</p><p> </p><p>For
 the next hour or so, the two were completely in studying mode, as none 
uttered a word. Ariel wanted to ask him a couple of questions concerning
 the work, but seeing how he was so concentrated made Ariel hesitant, 
lest he might snapped at her. It was only a few more days before the day
 of the exam finally approached. No wonder he was working so hard. Ariel
 found herself fascinated by his strong motivation to succeed in life. 
His character was totally the opposite from hers. While he was suffering
 his ass off under all this pressure of getting good grades, she was 
slacking off in unrealistic dreams and fantasies. While he buried 
himself inside the library, she sneaked off to arcades and games. There 
was definitely a huge difference in their lives.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel 
glanced back at the English book, her mind twirling at the thousand of 
words taunting at her. How could people do these things?! She asked 
inside her mind. She couldn't even keep her attention on the book for 
more than ten minutes before she had to quickly succumb to headaches.</p><p> </p><p>Time
 was passing by, yet Ariel was not even absorbing anything. This was 
fruitless. No matter how much she tried, she just couldn't focus!</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 decided to spark a conversation. "Say... Joe... What were you doing 
after school? You always asked for fifteen minutes before we can start 
our session..."</p><p> </p><p>Joe stopped what he was doing, perhaps surprised at her sudden question.</p><p> </p><p>Realizing the awkwardness, Ariel fumbled. "Oh... um... I was just curious, that's all. If it's too personal, never mind."</p><p> </p><p>"I went to the music room."</p><p> </p><p>Shocked,
 Ariel gazed at him. "Music room?" Her mind wandered back to the day 
when she saw him playing the piano... How could she forget? The 
beautiful melody enthralled her beyond words. For sure, she would never 
forget that melodious tune... "You play the piano every day?"</p><p> </p><p>He nodded.</p><p> </p><p>"Jeez,"
 Ariel said, quite grudgingly impressed. "You're smart... and you know 
how to play instruments! Man, what don't you know how to do???"</p><p> </p><p>"It's just for fifteen minutes. I have to play it to feel calm." There was a certain melancholy in his eyes, Ariel noticed.</p><p> </p><p>She
 suddenly remembered the conversation they shared in the woods. He 
mentioned something about a girl. Could this have been related to her?</p><p> </p><p>"You miss her, don't you?" Ariel asked.</p><p> </p><p>He was quite surprised that she brought it up.</p><p> </p><p>"I know you guys separated. But can't you two still keep in contact? Or something happened, didn't it?"</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 seemed quiet for a moment, as though contemplating if he should divulge
 his inner thoughts. Even though they weren't exactly on best-buddy 
terms, Ariel believed that after the conversation they had, it shouldn't
 be that difficult to speak about this now. Truthfully, she was quite 
interested about this girl, and how she got Joe so smitten about her.</p><p> </p><p>However, he disappointed her. "Nothing. An idiot like you wouldn't understand anyway."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 flinched. What was that? Why did he have to resort to calling her 
names? Suddenly, she felt her temper rising with an unstoppable force. 
"Excuse me?"</p><p> </p><p>"I said, you wouldn't understand."</p><p> </p><p>Her
 fists clenched and her jaw almost dropped. "How would you know if I 
wouldn't understand? You don't have to be so judgmental toward me! You 
don't even know me!"</p><p> </p><p>Joe seemed quite taken back by her 
strong reaction. However, his voice suggested no guilt. "I don't need to
 explain my life to strangers. We're just here to study. Don't get too 
personal with me."</p><p> </p><p>"Just what the hell is wrong with you?"
 Ariel asked. "I knew you'd show your true colors as a plain jerk that 
always puts on a front."</p><p> </p><p>That got him on the defensive. "What are you trying to say?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel scoffed. "Nothing. You wouldn't want to listen to an idiot talking, anyway."</p><p> </p><p>"I'm serious. You're hinting at something I don't quite exactly understand. Care to explain?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel grumbled. "I'm saying that you're a damn fake that puts on a front! There!"</p><p> </p><p>Joe's icy eyes were penetrating through her skin.</p><p> </p><p>"You're
 a first class jerk who belittles everyone else around you," Ariel 
elaborated. "You always show to the world how cool and smart you are and
 everyone always admire you for that. Yet inside, you hide your feelings
 and thoughts. You don't think anyone is worthy to get to know you. Why 
else would you act so arrogantly when I was just asking out of curiosity
 and perhaps, even concern?! You're pessimistic and cynical, and you 
doubt everyone's motive! People like you are better off buried in 
tombs!"</p><p> </p><p>His eyes were piercing through her with a heavy 
burning malice. "You think that by that narrowed-minded view, you can 
conclude that I am some kind of fake, and you, the genius that knows it 
*all* ?" He scoffed irritably. "Don't get your nose out of joint."</p><p> </p><p>"I'm not!" Ariel shouted. "You're just denying what I said is true!"</p><p> </p><p>"Oh
 yeah? If I'm such a hateful person that you made me to be, then why are
 you so persistent to date me?" Joe yelled. "Of course! It turns out 
that you're just trying to satisfy your desperate need to show off *and*
 a stupid bet! I think you're the one better off buried in tombs!"</p><p> </p><p>Comprehension
 cut off her breathing rapidly. So he did hear her conversation with 
Rainie after all. "You! You eavesdropped on me!!"</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I
 was eavesdropping on a group of girls who are shameless enough to speak
 loudly in public places," he derided sarcastically.</p><p> </p><p>"You..." Ariel sputtered. "You are so rude, do you know that?"</p><p> </p><p>"Rude? At least I'm not that shameless to go begging for a date just because I'm desperate for my ex's attention."</p><p> </p><p>Silence.</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 looked toward Ariel, sensing that he might have gone a bit too far. 
Guilt suddenly trampled him hard. "Listen, our emotions aren't stable 
right now--"</p><p> </p><p>"Way to jump over that fence, Joe!" Ariel 
retorted. "I don't want to speak to you anymore or hear empty apologies.
 You have a tendency to spit out words that always hurt me! I don't want
 to hear it!"</p><p> </p><p>His expression was dead and cold. "Fine by me." He turned away.</p><p> </p><p>"You
 see!" Ariel fumed. "You ignore others' needs because you're too 
absorbed with your own world. You may not want to admit it, but I can 
see through you more than you think I can--"</p><p> </p><p>"Shut up," he grumbled.</p><p> </p><p>"No!"
 Ariel yelled. "I'll have to get this through your thick head. The world
 doesn't revolve around you. You need to open your eyes and pay 
attention to others--"</p><p> </p><p>"Enough! I don't need your rubbish!
 You may *think* I'm those stereotypical dark guys that perky girls, 
like you, think you can change, but you never, *ever* will!!"</p><p> </p><p>"Perky girls like me?" Ariel repeated.</p><p> </p><p>"You
 think you can fix me?" he asked, rolling his eyes, "Sorry to break it 
to you, but I'm not an object you can use to validate your 
accomplishments with, Ariel."</p><p> </p><p>She fumed. "I'm not trying to fix you--"</p><p> </p><p>"Stop
 being so stubborn! I don't need your pity and I don't need your 
friendship! Just get out! Get out of my sight! Get out of my house! And 
most importantly, get out of my life!" Joe shouted at the top of his 
lungs.</p><p> </p><p>Shock ate her up entirely as Ariel raged in 
righteous indignation. She had never seen him react so fiercely before. 
It made her question herself whether or not she had stepped too 
comfortably in his territory. But still, even if she was stepping over 
the line, that did not give him the right to insult her like he did. No 
matter how low she might appear to him, Ariel couldn't accept his crude 
words and stabbing gestures toward her.</p><p> </p><p>Stupid jerk, she 
kept cursing in her mind. How could she have agreed to chase after him 
for a date? He was heartless! A complete monster! It would be suicide to
 have him as a boyfriend.</p><p> </p><p>Red-faced, Ariel decided to 
retreat with pride and dignity. She quickly dumped her stuff in her bag 
and marched out of the room, slamming the door on her way out.</p><p> <br>----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Okie
 dokes, here goes the update! Looks like things are turning sour for the
 duo. Is this really it? lol, I'm sure you know the answer to that one. 
What will Rainie do to interrupt Ariel's progess? Stay tuned! ^_~</p><p>Big
