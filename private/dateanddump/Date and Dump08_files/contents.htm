</p><p class="tocn"></p><h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="tocn"></p><h4><!--Subtitle begin-->Uh Oh... Bad Sign!<!--Subtitle end--></h4>
<!--Chapter begin-->
Ariel stumbled into her room and slammed the door. She was so angry she 
swore she was breathing in steams. Even the comfort of her room didn't 
tame down her frustration.<p> </p><p>"Jerk, jerk, jerk!" She screamed at
 the top of her lungs. Grabbing the pillows on her bed, she chucked them
 hard at the wall with ever-increasing exasperation. The tightened 
feeling in her chest was inexhaustible, making her feel like she needed 
to be torn apart in order for the anger to cease.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel 
slumped in her bed, still cursing like mad. She just couldn't stand the 
way he phrased his words towards her. On the outside, Ariel may seem 
tough and hard to get at, but in reality, her insides were even softer 
than caramel. She just couldn't digest too much of his harshness, 
especially when so much of it had hit so close to home.</p><p> </p><p>"Ariel dear?"</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly,
 her mother's voice perked up her ears. Mrs. Rilla Lin had just come 
home from a vacation overseas a few days before and Ariel couldn't be 
gladder to have her mother back.</p><p> </p><p>"Is something the 
matter?" The middle-aged woman asked in a tone so soft and motherly. She
 entered her daughter's room and sat on the bed next to her. Having a 
relationship that was even more intimate than that of best friends', 
Rilla could absolutely see through Ariel like a transparent glass.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 huffed, knowing that there should be no secrets between the two. 
"Rilla, you don't know! I'm so glad to have you back..." And she began 
to tell her mother the whole story, from meeting Mike again, to the 
challenge with her friends, and of course the arrogant jerk Joe Cheng 
and how he had hurt her so.</p><p> </p><p>"My poor, poor darling." Rilla patted Ariel's head with sympathy. "Actually, I'm very proud of you hon."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel looked up, confused.</p><p> </p><p>"I
 mean, you're very brave to confront Joe like that. This is what I like 
about my daughter. Always so straightforward." Rilla smiled, easing 
Ariel's tension. "But you weren't so with Mike's case, were you? Does he
 know about any of your feelings?"</p><p> </p><p>Rilla's question 
stirred many thoughts to surface in Ariel's mind. As far as she knew, 
Mike wasn't all that much concerned about how she felt. Wait a minute...
 All of these times, Ariel had put up a front for him to see. A strong 
Ariel who had already gotten over her ex. Even when they broke up, Ariel
 hadn't burst into tears for him to see. Now that she thought about it, 
it made perfect sense that he thought she was over him, and so getting 
into relationships without awkwardness.</p><p> </p><p>Rilla knew the answer when she saw that expression of Ariel's face. "Do you think all of these acts are worth it?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel knew her mom was referring to the challenge. "You don't think so?"</p><p> </p><p>"Well,
 that question is for you to answer. How long have you dated Mike? Two 
years? Do you think wasting more time on someone you can never get back 
is the solution?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel thought for a moment. Indeed, two 
years was not a short time. In those years, Ariel could say that she was
 happy. They were so lovey dovey towards each other that everybody 
thought they were going to grow up marrying. How wrong they were.</p><p> </p><p>Sighing,
 Ariel came to realize how pointless this all seemed. First of all, Mike
 didn't care about her anymore. He was probably out having fun with his 
new girlfriend, or even worse on the bed with them while she moped about
 him and racking her brains out for ways to spite him.</p><p> </p><p>But
 she found it so hard to accept how Mike could throw away what they had 
and shared with so much ease as though they worth nothing. How could he?
 How could he at all? Did he really love her those past two years?</p><p> </p><p>Rilla squeezed Ariel's arms. "I'll make dinner for you. What do you want to eat?"</p><p> </p><p>"Anything." Ariel replied, appreciative.</p><p> </p><p>When Rilla left, Ariel found herself thinking. Was all of this really pointless?</p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p> </p><p>It
 was a week after the argument at Joe's house. Neither Joe and Ariel 
bothered to take the initiative to apologize, much less forgive. After 
hearing her mother's words, Ariel reflected a lot. She asked herself 
countless times what was the reason for her to indulge in such 
ridiculous stunts. Her mom was right. Mike had already moved on long 
ago; there was absolutely no need to find ways to grab his attention 
when he didn't care about her anymore. With that in mind, Ariel had long
 forgotten about the bet. She decided to turn a new leaf, often staying 
after classes to catch up in her work such that she almost didn't even 
have time for her friends.</p><p> </p><p>It was one Thursday afternoon 
when she was heading to grab lunch when Joe appeared at her side out of 
nowhere. The sight of him made Ariel gasp fretfully, for she had not 
recovered from his harsh blows. For the last few days, they had regarded
 the other as complete strangers, never exchanging a word. Yet... why 
did he appear in front of her now?</p><p> </p><p>"What do you want?" 
Ariel said coldly, not even daring to stare into his eyes. The mere 
presence of him made her blood boil, her fists clenched.</p><p> </p><p>"I need to talk to you," he told her seriously, peering down.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel showed no interest. "Really? I thought you want me out of your life. Why the sudden change?"</p><p> </p><p>He
 yanked her behind a secret wall before she could even protest. His 
force was so strong that Ariel found it fruitless to rebel. "Listen, 
your friends are driving me nuts."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel's eyes widened in
 shock as she speculated. She knew that she had never told her friends 
of her new determination to ditch the clawing troubles of the bet. What 
were her friends up to now?</p><p> </p><p>She forced on a look of indifference, as though bearing no care to what he was saying. "So?"</p><p> </p><p>"So?" Joe drawled. "Tell them to stop pestering me. They keep asking me to help them study."</p><p> </p><p>Something
 rang in Ariel's head. Now, what reason could her friends have to do 
that? Considering Rainie's character, she'd never study even if a gun 
pointed at a head. Okay, so even if she did want to, she had Gillian to 
help. There was no need to confront someone else, much less the cold 
prince. Her mind trailed to the day when she exchanged new conditions 
with Rainie. Rainie had specifically announced that she would 
"interfere" with the whole Joe-date ordeal. Could it be one of her 
stunts?</p><p> </p><p>Still, Ariel remained unaffected by his news. 
"Then tell them to stop yourself. The cold prince always have ways to 
brush people off without feeling guilty. Why can't you shoo them away 
now?"</p><p> </p><p>"You think I haven't tried? They're like bees 
trailing after honey. Until they get what they want, hell knows when 
they will retreat."</p><p> </p><p>Rainie must think that by spending 
time with Joe, she could hinder Ariel from tremendous progress. What 
Rainie didn't know was that Ariel had already given up. She and Joe 
hardly ever contacted. Yet, how ironic was that Rainie's effort at 
trying to separate them was actually bringing them together now.</p><p> </p><p>"What do you want me to do? If they're so persistent, I can't stop them," Ariel declared.</p><p> </p><p>"They're your friends."</p><p> </p><p>"I'm not their parents."</p><p> </p><p>"You can tell them to stop."</p><p> </p><p>"Last time I checked, I don't have control over their lives."</p><p> </p><p>Joe was getting impatient. "So what, you're saying you don't care? Fine. Don't blame me when I resort to the extremities."</p><p> </p><p>His statement made Ariel eye him with intensity. "What do you mean by that?"</p><p> </p><p>He smirked. "Seeing how they are so interested in spending time with me, what do you think?"</p><p> </p><p>"You-"
 Ariel pointed a bobbing finger in an attempt to look intimidating, yet 
even with such fierceness, her height was a huge disadvantage. It was 
hard to look intimidating when you're a head or so shorter. "Don't you 
dare plan anything fishy! The reason they're bothering you is because 
they have a reason!"</p><p> </p><p>Joe quirked an eyebrow in interest. "And exactly that means...?"</p><p> </p><p>"Don't
 act dumb! I know you've heard our conversation the other day," Ariel 
snapped bluntly. "They want to distract your attention from me so that I
 can't spend time with you! If I don't, then I won't have a chance to be
 your girlfriend, therefore lose the bet! Can't you see?"</p><p> </p><p>His
 eyes lit up in amusement as he stared hard at nothing particular, as 
though in deep contemplation. "So it all comes to that bet, doesn't it?"
 He rolled his eyes in a degrading manner. "You girls are so pathetic, 
always coming up with these brainless tactics for entertainment. Don't 
you find it a waste of time?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel grew even more furious
 at the emergence of his cockiness. He never ceased to show his 
superiority among others. "Yeah, we're so pathetic, and you're sooo 
wise! That's why you spend twenty-four hours burying your head in 
books!"</p><p> </p><p>"I rather do that than waste my time thinking of stupid ways to court guys."</p><p> </p><p>"We're
 not courting guys!!" Ariel yelled. "We're... experimenting! It's not 
like the way I chased you for a date speak for my feelings toward you! I
 was just doing it for fun."</p><p> </p><p>"Fun? Then what happened?" Joe taunted. "Did you succeed? You ran away in tears, didn't you?"</p><p> </p><p>He
 caught her right there. Ariel's mouth was opened but words failed to 
convey her thoughts.  True, the bet was a ridiculous, impulsive decision
 that she made out of a spontaneous desire to show off to Mike. Needless
 to say, it was stupid of her, and she had learned to back off. Her 
fault lied in her neglecting to tell her friends. Now, it all boiled 
down to the only simple explanation. Ariel was avoiding.</p><p> </p><p>"Well? Can't you say something?"</p><p> </p><p>"Must
 you be so annoying?" Ariel asked, irritated. "Fine, you want me to tell
 them to stop, all right? I will do as you wish just as long as you 
agree on my condition."</p><p> </p><p>Joe's eyes turned to a darker color. He was careful not to promise before he heard the condition. "What do you want?"</p><p> </p><p>"Be my boyfriend."</p><p> </p><p>Exasperation
 was clearly shown on his face as Joe eyed her with incredulity. "What 
the hell is your problem? Why would you want that when you're planning 
to call off the bet anyway?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel rolled her eyes. "Look,
 I know my friend pretty well. She isn't going to give up until we have 
results for the deal. We can all end this by you agreeing to be my 
boyfriend. Rainie will surely be satisfied and accept her lose."</p><p> </p><p>"Just admit that you want to win, after all."</p><p> </p><p>"What's wrong with that?" Ariel asked.</p><p> </p><p>"Damn cheap," Joe mumbled. "Don't think I'm not aware of your intention. You're still adamant about getting back at your ex."</p><p> </p><p>How
 was it possible that he knew so much? Not that it was true, but Ariel 
found that he always had a way to spit salt onto her wounds. She bit 
back her tongue from lashing. "You can say whatever you want. I don't 
care anymore, but this is the only way to make Rainie quit without 
hurting any party. It is precisely the perfect tactic."</p><p> </p><p>"'Without hurting any party'?" Joe repeated. "As far as I know, I detest being in this."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 rolled her eyes. "Come on, I'm also doing you a big favor. With a 
beautiful girlfriend like me by your side, your infamous gay rumors will
 surely dispense."</p><p> </p><p>"Forget about it." Joe spat, on the verge of walking away. "I have better things to do."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 stopped him. "Wei, you should be glad that I'm not angry at you anymore
 for your words that day. I don't expect you to apologize, but at least,
 pay me some respect and listen to what I have to say."</p><p> </p><p>"Say what you want to say then." He looked annoyed.</p><p> </p><p>"It doesn't hurt to have me as a girlfriend, does it? Fine, I'll accommodate you. How about just for one week?"</p><p> </p><p>This time, Joe looked bored. "No," he simply said.</p><p> </p><p>"You said you don't want my friends bothering you anymore," Ariel pointed out.</p><p> </p><p>He
 inched nearer towards her, bending down so their eyes met at the same 
level. "On second thoughts, I rather they bother me than going out with a
 pinhead like you," Joe said suavely.</p><p> </p><p>"You..." Ariel 
sputtered with a finger pointed at him. Here he was at it again! 
Insulting her! Ariel could not contain her tolerance any longer. She did
 what she would never imagined to do. She slapped him. Hard.</p><p> </p><p>"Wei, why did you slap me?" Joe hissed with a hand rubbing his cheek.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel's face was red. "An insensitive jerk like you deserve it!" She spat.</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 glared hardly at her. She didn't know if he was angry because of her 
reason or because of the slap itself, but in any case, his anger was 
palpable. Again, she witnessed his rarefied expression. And honestly, 
she didn't like it. He looked so scary that her heart thrashed faster. 
Ariel didn't know what was going to happen next.</p><p> </p><p>"Ariel, is that you?"</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly,
 a voice pierced the tension like a sword. Almost immediately, the two 
ripped their gazes away from each other and towards the person who had 
just called Ariel's name.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel's heart almost stopped.</p><p> </p><p>"It
 is you," Mike confirmed, taking a closer look. He approached them, with
 a apprehensive Hebe by his side. What was he doing here? Ariel had just
 met him a week ago and encountering him again was all too soon.</p><p> </p><p>Joe observed the two, instantly grasping on what was going on through Ariel's awkwardness.</p><p> </p><p>When
 Mike was near, he gazed at Joe, who had a slightly bored look on his 
expression. "Your boyfriend?" Ariel wasn't sure, but was there a little 
infuriation in his tone? The notion puzzled Ariel.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel 
wanted to say yes just to see what Mike's reaction would be, but she 
knew that would be wrong. "None of your business," she simply said.</p><p> </p><p>Mike's expression hardened. Ariel was confused as to why he suddenly took a care in her business. "How come you never told me?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 felt the urge to scoff in his face. The way he was acting looked as if 
he was still bearing the position as a friend, and right now, Ariel 
considered him anything but. She remembered her mother's words about how
 she never showed him her real feelings. All of the sudden, Ariel was 
tempted to let him have a piece of her mind.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm sorry, but who are you to me? Why do I have to report every single little thing to you?" Ariel said bitingly.</p><p> </p><p>Mike
 seemed surprised. Of course he would. The past few months she had acted
 so fake around him, feigning that she was fine and being sickeningly 
polite. But now, Ariel had enough of the bullshit. It was time to 
release her inner turmoil for him to see.</p><p> </p><p>"So you two are 
really going out?" Mike asked. He seemed a bit hurt, but was it any of 
his business? Why was he acting as if he cared when he clearly didn't? 
If he did, he wouldn't have jumped into a relationship before they even 
broke up. If he cared, he wouldn't flaunt in her face all the time with 
his sweet beautiful girlfriend. If he cared, he would have known that 
all of her politeness was a mask for him to see. If he cared, he would 
have known everything!</p><p> </p><p>"So what if we are?" Ariel ticked off. Joe's expression became alarmed instantly as he hissed a "Wei".</p><p> </p><p>Mike's
 eyes bore on the both of them. Hebe was utterly confused by the current
 situation but somehow she was keeping quiet. "Really? Is that so? I 
don't believe you. Joe Cheng, the school's cold prince, never went out 
with anyone. If you two were really going out, everyone would know."</p><p> </p><p>Ariel's eyes flinched. Mike smirked as he knew his words were right.</p><p> </p><p>"It’s not your business!” Ariel snapped.</p><p> </p><p>"Mike, let's go," Hebe was getting impatient.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 couldn't resist but add a taunt, "Yeah, Mike. You should go or else 
your girlfriend will get jealous at how you're paying so much attention 
to me."</p><p> </p><p>Hebe tensed at Ariel's cynical remark, instantly 
making Ariel feel a bit guilty for saying such a nasty thing. Hebe had 
always been a sweet girl and it was impossible not to feel regretful 
when you did her wrong. "Why do you say that? You guys are casual 
friends, right?"</p><p> </p><p>Somehow, Hebe's innocence annoyed Ariel 
all the more. She just couldn't take how honeysweet the girl was. "I 
don't know. Do you want us to be? Because you know, he seems to have a 
habit of sleeping around with casual friends."</p><p> </p><p>From the 
side, Joe was smirking at Ariel's stupid comment. She was basically 
degrading herself by putting herself in such statement, but Joe remained
 silent as he watched the show.</p><p> </p><p>Hebe's eyes widened. "What are you talking about, Ariel?"</p><p> </p><p>Mike,
 of course, knew what Ariel was implying. Hell, he should know. 
"Ariel..." he beckoned for her attention in a soft tone. Ariel wasn't 
sure, but was there some sort of uptightness in his eyes? Perhaps, there
 was something that he wanted to tell her? Ariel softened for a second. 
"I..." Mike seemed hesitant, but when he looked at Hebe, he immediately 
changed his expression. "You know what? I was wrong about us being 
friends. I don't think we can be after this. You're still so childish as
 ever."</p><p> </p><p>Mike's harsh remark stabbed Ariel right in the 
chest. The pain was so excruciating that Ariel swore she could feel her 
heart breaking. "Yes, I'm so childish! But you're far off even worse, 
always thinking you're right. Do you ever care about my feelings?"</p><p> </p><p>Mike seemed astonished. "What feelings? I thought we parted on good terms."</p><p> </p><p>"That's what you thought!" Ariel cried.</p><p> </p><p>Mike
 studied her. From the way he was looking at her, Ariel knew she had let
 him see through her far too much. Instantly, she put on her guard. It 
wasn't deliberate, just a female instinct. "Forget it! I don't care 
about you anymore!"</p><p> </p><p>She was about to dash off in utter humiliation when Mike's voice stopped her. "You still like me?"</p><p> </p><p>The air was so silent it was almost deafening. Everyone's eyes laid on Ariel as they waited for her answer.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 turned around and laughed bitterly. Things had already gotten to this 
point that it didn't matter how much of a fool she'd make of herself. 
"It's been three months. I had long gotten over you!" She denied. At 
least she’d save herself a piece of dignity.</p><p> </p><p>Mike's eyes 
were unrelenting. He appeared confident. "Ariel, you don't have to lie 
to yourself. If you still like me, say so. I can understand. In the 
future, I'll try to avoid you so as to make it easier for you--"</p><p> </p><p>"You think too highly of yourself," Joe interjected. "What makes you think she still likes you?"</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 was a bit surprised at Joe's sudden interference. He had kept quiet all
 the time that she barely noticed him. In fact, she thought he had long 
left.</p><p> </p><p>"For your information, Ariel has a boyfriend." Ariel
 looked up at him, surprised as Joe pulled her closer towards him, his 
arms wrapping about her slim waist. Mike's shocked expression was 
priceless. "We've been going out secretly for a week now, that's why you
 didn't know. But I'm making it clear to you now. She's completely over 
you, so flatten your ego a bit, will you?"</p><p> </p><p>Mike gazed at Ariel for confirmation, but she was way too shocked to show appropriate emotions.</p><p> </p><p>"Come
 on, sweetie, let's go shall we?" Joe asked in a tone so sweet it was 
barely recognizable. They were still under Mike's scrutinizing gaze, and
 being a typical Joe, he perfectly knew it. To spite him, Joe kissed 
Ariel's cheek, further sending her into the pit of delusion.</p><p> </p><p>Entangling her hands into his, Joe pulled the stiff Ariel from the scene, leaving Mike stunned and Hebe feeling bizarre.</p><p> </p><p>When the two turned around a corner, Joe immediately released Ariel's hands.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 was still clouded by shock. Seeing that, Joe recovered his bored 
expression and said annoyingly, "I was just helping you out. Don't have 
any silly ideas."</p><p> </p><p>She blinked several times. It took her a
 while but she finally regained normality. Instantly, her eyes flashed 
when she registered that she had just been manipulated. “How dare you! 
Who told you to do that?!”</p><p> </p><p>“Why are you yelling?” Joe asked. “I must have been out of my mind to help an ungrateful person like you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Nobody
 told you to help me!” Ariel bellowed exasperatedly, not believing his 
condescending tone. “For your information, I would never ever want a 
boyfriend like you! Not only are you rude, you’re brutal, cold, 
insensitive, inconsiderate, mean, arrogant--”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you done?”</p><p> </p><p>“—selfish,
 full of yourself, evil, self-absorbed, indifferent, unfeeling—you are 
the most despicable thing to ever grace planet Earth! I must be mad if I
 ever want you as a boyfriend!”</p><p> </p><p>“And that Mike is your ideal type of boyfriend?” Joe asked. “You have some taste.”</p><p> </p><p>“W-what?”
 Ariel sputtered angrily. “Ok! So my taste is bad! That did not give you
 the right to do what you just did a moment before! Now everyone would 
know that we’re going out--” Ariel stopped short, realization slamming 
her hard. Oh my god. Things just suddenly dawned upon her. Did Joe just 
pose as her boyfriend? Did that mean that they were official? Did this 
mean that she had just won the challenge? Did she successfully show off 
to Mike?</p><p>Yes, yes, yes, and yes!!! In less than fifteen minutes 
she had kill four birds with one stone. It was funny. Just when she was 
on the verge of giving up everything, the unexpected twist of events 
thrust her back into the fire she’d been trying to climb out. She had to
 admit, accomplishment had never felt so sweet. “Oh my God!” Ariel 
squealed, jumping up and down as elation shot through her body, all 
anger seemingly to have vanished. “I did it! I did it!”</p><p> </p><p>“Shut up, will you?” Joe looked at her with increasing vexation at her abrupt change of moods. “Why are you so happy?”</p><p> </p><p>“Joe,
 Joe, Joe!” Ariel screeched, grabbing his hands with jumpy enthusiasm. 
“Do you know what this mean?! We’re officially an item! Oh my God!”</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 jerked his hands away but she was still smiling like an idiot. “Mind 
what you say. I was brainless for one second. I have no intention to be 
your real boyfriend, do you understand?”</p><p> </p><p>Ariel was too 
ecstatic to be listening to him. “I can’t believe it! Did you see Mike’s
 expression back there?!” She asked, recalling.</p><p> </p><p>He rolled his eyes. “Please. He was just shocked that a girl with bad conditions like you could get a guy like me.”</p><p> </p><p>She
 still wasn’t listening. "I can't wait to tell Rainie and Gillian this! 
They'd be so surprised! Oh my god, Joe. You’re so damn gorgeous for what
 you did. I love you!" Unconsciously, she threw her arms around him.</p><p> </p><p>Joe
 was shocked, and upon feeling the tension in his body, Ariel 
immediately jumped back, finally realizing what she'd just done. Silence
 exploded in the air as discomfort and tension rolled in.</p><p> </p><p>Ariel
 tucked a few hair strands behind her ears, nervous-wrecked. "I... I'm 
going to go now," she uttered embarrassedly before scurrying away.</p><p> </p><p>Stupid,
 stupid, stupid! What were you doing, Ariel? Why did you hug him? That 
was just so stupid of you! What would he think of you now?</p><p> </p><p>In
 the midst of endless babbling and cursing at herself, her mind flashed 
back to the kiss on the cheek earlier. Instantly, her cheeks flushed and
 hotness sauntered through her body. She didn't know why, but her heart 
was beating furiously, as if it would jump out of her ribcage any time 
soon.</p><p> </p><p>Thump, thump, thump.</p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p> <br>Hi everybody! Just wanna say that we're very appreciative toward your support! </p><p>Hehehe,
 did you guys expect that Joe would take it this far?  Be prepared for 
more drama now that Mike has stepped in the picture, again!<br> <br>Anyway, your feedback is most definitely welcomed!!!!!</p><p>With lotsa love,<br>Nhu
